Lucid dreams occur quite rarely, so research has focused on different induction methods to increase lucid dream frequency. In the sleep laboratory setting the wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) technique in combination with the mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD) technique is very effective. The present study with N = 50 participants in line with previous studies - indicates that these techniques are also effective at home with a lucid dream percentage of 18% after WBTB nights compared to 6% after non-WBTB nights. Of the 10 naïve participants who had never had a lucid dream before, 50% experienced at least one lucid dream during the 5-week period. Future studies using longer time intervals can investigate the questions whether everyone can learn lucid dreaming if s/he puts in the effort and how intensive induction training affect lucid dreaming frequency in the long run.

There have been suggestions that the deliberate alteration of sleep-related behaviors, such as briefly going back to sleep after waking, can be used to induce lucid dreams. The current study extends this work by investigating the association between lucid dream frequency and alarm clock use. Eighty-four participants (44 females, 39 males, 1 not stated, mean age = 33.80 years, SD = 15.00) completed an online retrospective questionnaire that measured lucid dreaming frequency, frequency of alarm clock use, frequency of snooze button use per morning, and average number of awakenings per night. Significant positive relationships were found between lucid dreaming frequency and number of awakenings per night (ρ = .30), number of uses of alarm clock snoozing function per morning (ρ = .22), and dream recall frequency (ρ = .52). In a logistic regression, whether a participant had ever had a lucid dream was predicted only by overall dream recall frequency and frequency of snooze button use (Exp(B) odds ratios = 4.92 and 2.52, respectively). Reasons for the association might be that lucid dreamers and snooze button users share some individual difference characteristic or that the brief awakenings followed by snoozing might elicit brain activation or sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, hence resulting in a greater likelihood of lucid dreams.

Previous experiments combining cognitive techniques and sleep disruption have been relatively successful in inducing at-home lucid dreams (LD) over training periods of 1 week or more. Here, we induce LD in a single laboratory nap session by pairing cognitive training with external stimulation. Participants came to the laboratory at 7:30 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. and during polysomnography setup were provided with information about lucid dreaming. For 20 min prior to sleep the experimenter played alternating audio and visual cues at 1-min intervals. Participants were instructed to practice a mental state of critical self-awareness, observing their thoughts and experiences each time they noticed a cue. This procedure associated the cues with the trained mental state. Subsequently, participants were allowed 90 min to nap, and the audio and visual cues were presented during REM sleep to activate self-awareness in dreams and elicit lucidity. A control group followed the same procedure but was not cued during sleep. All participants were instructed to signal their lucidity by looking left and right 4 times (LR signal). Signal-verified lucid dreams (SVLDs) qualified as dreams in which the LR signal was observed and the participant reported becoming lucid. Across the 2 nap times, this protocol induced SVLDs in 50% of cued participants. In the absence of cueing during sleep, participant SVLD rate was 17%. Of note, 3 successful participants had never before experienced a LD, suggesting this protocol may be effective across the general population. Implications of this Targeted Lucidity Reactivation protocol for nightmare treatment are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"

The study found no differences between those who did and did not report lucid dreams during the program on baseline measures of field independence, locus of control or need for cognition. There was an observed significant change toward a field independent orientation between baseline and posttests for those successful at inducing a lucid dream; with no statistically significant differences for either Locus of Control or Need for Cognition. Results suggest that field independence may not be a predispositional characteristic for the successful induction of lucid dreaming, but an experiential result of having lucid dream experiences.
