10.3390/clockssleep4020021,Combining Wake-Up-Back-to-Bed with Cognitive Induction Techniques: Does Earlier Sleep Interruption Reduce Lucid Dream Induction Rate?,"Lucid dreaming offers the chance to investigate dreams from within a dream and by real-time dialogue between experimenters and dreamers during REM sleep. This state of consciousness opens a new experimental venue for dream research. However, laboratory study in this field is limited due to the rarity of lucid dreamers. In a previous study, we were able to induce in 50% of the participants a lucid dream in a single sleep laboratory night by combining a wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) sleep routine and a mnemonic method (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, MILD). In three experiments, we tried to replicate our earlier findings while we adapted our procedure in shortening (Exp1–3: 4.5 vs. 6 h of uninterrupted sleep in the first half of the night), simplifying (Exp2: time-based wakening vs. REM wakening in the second half of the night), and applying another induction technique (Exp3: reality testing vs. MILD). In the three conditions, four out of 15 (26%), zero out of 20 (0%), and three out of 15 (20%) participants reported a lucid dream. Compared to the original study, the earlier sleep interruption seems to reduce the lucid dream induction rate. Furthermore, without REM awakenings in the morning, lucid dream induction failed, whereas reality testing showed a lower success rate compared to MILD. Further systematic sleep laboratory studies are needed to develop reliable techniques for lucid dream research."

However, laboratory research in this area is limited because frequent lucid dreamers are rare. Several studies demonstrated that different methods of induction could increase the number of lucid dreams. In four field studies, a combination of a wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) sleep protocol and a mnemonic technique (MILD) showed promising results. To further investigate the effectiveness of this combined approach, we conducted a sleep laboratory experiment with four different conditions. The general experimental procedure was the following: Participants were awakened after 6 h of sleep from a subsequent REM period and kept awake for 30 or 60 min, during which they were asked to practice MILD or a control task (e.g., reading). Then they returned to bed for a morning sleep period. In the first condition eleven sport students, who attended a seminar on sleep and dreams, spent one night in a sleep laboratory. To avoid biases due to the seminar attendance (e.g., higher motivation), in the second condition 15 participants who did not attend the seminar were recruited. In the third condition, 14 sport students were tested with a shorter awakening period (30 min). Finally, the fourth condition served as a control condition, whereas eleven sport students slept two non-consecutive nights in a laboratory. Instead of MILD, in one night the participants read a book (fiction, unrelated to dreams), while in the other night they played a Nintendo Wii video game. In the first three conditions, six (54%), eight (53%), and five participants (36%) reported lucid dreams during the morning sleep period, whereas three, (27%), four (27%), and two participants (14%) produced PSG-verified eye signals. In contrast, in the reading condition, only one (9%) participant reported lucid dreams and no eye movements. No lucid dreams were observed in the Wii condition. The findings of the present study show that by using a combination of WBTB and MILD, lucid dreams can be effectively induced in people who are not selected for their lucid dream abilities."
10.1016/j.concog.2018.05.012,Exploring the effects of galantamine paired with meditation and dream reliving on recalled dreams: Toward an integrated protocol for lucid dream induction and nightmare resolution.,"An experimental home study examined the impact of a pre-sleep protocol for enhancing self-awareness, lucidity, and responsiveness in dreams. It included ingesting the cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine--which is widely reported to increase the frequency of lucid dreaming--prior to engaging in middle-of-the-night meditation and the imaginary reliving of a distressing dream while exercising new responses. Thirty-five participants completed an eight-night study, which included pre- and post-baseline nights and six conditions: waking for 40 min before returning to bed, called Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB); Wake-Back-to-Bed plus placebo (WBTB + P); Wake-Back-to-Bed plus galantamine (WBTB + G); meditation and dream reliving (MDR); meditation and dream reliving plus placebo (MDR + P); and meditation and dream reliving plus galantamine (MDR + G). The outcome measures included lucidity, reflectiveness, interactive behavior, role change, constructive action, and fear and threat, as measured by the participants' self-ratings. The results support the use of this protocol in further studies of lucid dream induction and nightmare/trauma resolution."

10.1007/978-3-319-95453-0_8,Lucid Dreaming,"Lucid dreams are defined as dreams in which the dreamer knows that she/he is dreaming. This fascinating state of mind is relatively rare but there is a variety of validated induction methods to increase lucid dream frequency. For the dreamer lucid dreams are fun (e.g., flying) and helpful (coping with nightmares or training motor skills). For the researcher, lucid dreaming is fascinating because skilled lucid dreamers can produce signals by moving their eyes in a specific pattern and the recording machine can measure these movements. For example, the dreamer can signal becoming lucid, then count to ten (or taking ten steps), and signal again. The researcher can check the recoding to know how long counting to ten took in the dream. In an fMRI-EEG study, a lucid dreamer did hand clenching in the dream and activity in the motor cortex was found; a sophisticated way to demonstrate the body-mind relationship during sleep."

10.31234/osf.io/bn8dr,Active Imagination as an  Alternative to Lucid Dreaming: Theory and Experimental Results,"Lucid dreaming (LD) is a fun and interesting activity, but most participants have difficulties in attaining lucidity, retaining it during the dream, concentrating on the needed task and remembering the results. This motivates to search for a new way to enhance lucid dreaming via different induction techniques, including chemicals and electric brain stimulation. However, results are still unstable. An alternative approach is to reach the lucid dreaming-like states via altered state of consciousness not related to dreaming. Several methods such as guided visualization, internal dialog, creative writing, hypnosis, hypnagogia, daydreaming, DMT trips, voice dialog, shamanic journey, rebirthing, and “forcing” tulpas can help in attaining such states. One of the most promising of them is Jungian “active imagination” (AIM) technique, which allows unconscious content to build up inside some mental frames. This article explores the hypothesis of replacing lucid dreaming research with active imagination, and the conditions and ways to accomplish it. Method: An open label pilot experiment was performed in 2004-2005 in Moscow, Russia with 100 participants. Results: The results show that there are two groups of people: ones with “visual imagination screen” and others have “mental imagination screen”. AIM works perfectly as a replacement for lucid dreams only for the first group of people. For the second group, it created interesting content, but not visual or emotional intensity equal to enter lucid dreaming like state. No known instruments helped to move the person from one group to another. The first group consisted of young females, while the second mostly contained males with rational and mathematical type of personality. Conclusion: AIM partly works as a replacement for LD, as it works great only for half of people, and it requires a sitter. However, AIM outperforms LD in reliability and availability in any circumstance: it could be performed even by text chat or in a crowd. It is also better than LD in retaining concentration on topic and the easiness of memorizing the results (which could be recorded). Self-performed AIM is less effective. AIM can be improved by intelligent chat bots as sitters and weak brain stimulation that can increase the probability of attaining something like hypnogogic state."

10.31219/osf.io/rh4qs,Partial memory reinstatement while (lucid) dreaming to change the dream environment,"Lucid dreams often coincide with having control over dream events in real-time, although the limitations of dream control are not completely understood. The current study probed the ability of lucid dreamers to reinstate waking scene memories while dreaming. After brief exposure to an experimental scene, participants were asked to reinstate the scene while lucid dreaming (i.e., change dream scenery to match real-world scene). Qualitative analysis revealed that successful dream scene reinstatements were overwhelmingly inaccurate with respect to the original experimental scene. Importantly, reinstatement inaccuracies held even when the dreamer was aware of them during the dream, suggesting a dissociation between memory access while dreaming and dream imagery. The ability to change the environment of a dream speaks to the high amount of lucid dream control, yet the inaccuracies speak to a lack of detailed control. Reinstating context during lucid sleep offers an experimental method to investigate sleep, dreams, and memory."
10.1007/978-1-4757-0423-5_7,The Psychophysiology of Lucid Dreaming,"Although we are usually unaware of the fact that we are dreaming while we are dreaming, at times a remarkable exception occurs, and our consciousness becomes lucid enough for us to realize that we are dreaming. Lucid dreamers report being able to freely remember the circumstances of waking life, to think clearly, and to act deliberately upon reflection, all the while experiencing a dream world that seems vividly real (Green, 1968; LaBerge, 1985a). This is all in contrast to the usual characterization of dreams as typically lacking any reflective awareness or true volition (Rechtschaffen, 1978)."
10.1007/978-1-4757-0423-5_13,Personal Experiences in Lucid Dreaming,"My first lucid dream arose from my discovery as a child of 5 that I could wake myself from frightening dreams by trying to shout “Mother!” Having gained confidence through this discovery that I could escape from unpleasant dreams, I allowed them to continue longer than before. The first time I did this was in a dream in which I seemed to be falling. My instinct was to wake myself before I reached the ground, but, instead, I allowed the fall to go on; by now I was fairly sure that there was no real danger because it was only a dream. As I remember, the fall ended in no sudden bump, but, instead, the dream changed and turned out not to be unpleasant at all."
10.21203/rs.3.rs-1303397/v1,"Nightmares, Mindfulness And Lucid Dreaming","Abstract
        A theoretical and empirical association between lucid dreaming and mindfulness, as well as lucid dreaming and nightmares has previously been observed; however, the relationship between nightmares and mindfulness has received surprisingly little attention. Here, we present the findings of two studies exploring the relation of nightmare frequency and distress with two components of mindfulness, termed presence and acceptance, as well as lucid dreaming. Study 1 (N=338) consisted of a low percentage of frequent lucid dreamers whereas Study 2 (N=187) consisted primarily of frequent lucid dreamers that used lucid dream induction training techniques and meditation. Mindful acceptance showed a more robust association with nightmare-related variables in comparison to mindful presence. Meditation expertise inversely related to nightmare frequency and the practice of lucid dreaming induction techniques inversely related to nightmare frequency and distress. Finally, in Study 2 a positive correlation between lucid dreaming frequency and mindfulness was apparent. The present findings support the notion that wakeful mindfulness is associated with the quality of dreams and extend previous research by suggesting a disentangled role of the two facets of mindfulness in dream variation. This association remains open for experimental manipulation, the result of which could have clinical implications."

10.1007/978-1-4757-0423-5_2,Lucid Dreaming in Western Literature,"Although Plato wrote that the faculty of reason is suspended during sleep, his pupil, Aristotle, was the first to state clearly, in his treatise On Dreams, that often, when we are asleep, there is something in our consciousness that tells us that what we are experiencing is only a dream. Beyond merely describing lucid dreaming, the “first scientist” also sought to explain how such a thing could happen. He argued that if someone were to place his finger directly in front of your eyes without your observing his doing it, the resulting double image would cause you to believe that you were seeing two fingers. If on the other hand, you were to observe his finger as it nears your eye, you would not be misled by your double vision into believing that there actually were two fingers. “Exactly so it is in the states of sleep,” Aristotle continued, “if the sleeper perceives that he is asleep, and is conscious of the sleeping state during which the perception comes before his mind, it presents itself still, but something within him speaks to this effect: ‘The image of Koriskos presents itself, but the real Koriskos is not present’ ” (Aristotle, 1952, pp. 702–706)."

 The subject of this study is to identify the connection between the experience obtained in lucid dreams and the experience of meditation. The object of the study is the experience that accompanies the state of awareness (Pali-sati). In the article, the author presents the results of a study aimed at establishing the connection between the experience obtained in lucid dreams and the experience of meditation. The works of the lucid dream researchers Stephen LaBerge, Jayne Gackenbach, Ursula Voss, Robert Waggoner, Tadas Stumbrys and others, as well as the work of researchers of the state of awareness - Bhikkhu Analayo, Henepola Gunaratana, Alan Wallace and others served as the theoretical and methodological basis of the study. The following research methods were used: the theoretical analysis of scientific literature, the analysis and generalization of empirical data, the formulation of conclusions. The theoretical significance and scientific novelty of the study lies in the systematization of theoretical provisions on the problem of the study of lucid dreams; discovering the features of the relationship of experience gained in lucid dreams with the experience obtained during meditation. The practical significance of the study lies in the fact that the results and conclusions of the study can be used by psychologists in their professional activities, as well as by lucid dreaming practitioners. The main conclusions of scientific research is the discovery of the similarity of experiences during lucid dreams with the experience gained in the state of meditation. The results of the survey conducted by the author show that a significant part of respondents who practice lucid dreaming also practice mindfulness meditation.

10.31234/osf.io/5x6hj,I did not expect to be dreaming: Explaining realization in lucid dreams with a Bayesian framework,"The commonsense view is that a lucid dream starts when the dreamer realizes that they are currently dreaming. The notion of realization, however, has been accepted at face value, with little consideration of whether the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming in the sense of actual reasoning, or if it is a mere epiphenomenon of lucid dream initiation. This article offers a solution to this problem by, first, arguing that the transition to lucidity can occur as a result of successful reasoning, and second, building a model of this reasoning in terms of probabilistic reasoning. The established Bayesian model explains realization in lucid dreams taking under consideration two factors: the beliefs that the dreamer holds on what is generally probable and improbable, and the dreamer’s admissibility of being in a dream. Defended against important objections, the model offers an explanation of lucid dream initiation, relevant for future research on dreaming."
10.1007/978-1-4757-0423-5_10,Individual Differences Associated with Lucid Dreaming,"Lucid dreaming has been said to be within the capability of all individuals (LaBerge, 1985). Based on analyses of the incidence of this dream experience among university students and among persons with an expressed interest in dreaming, a majority have reported experiencing at least one lucid dream during their lifetime, and about 20% have reported experiencing lucid dreams with relative frequency. Our goal in this chapter is to describe and to integrate what has been learned through research about individuals who experience lucid dreams. To this end we will present data derived from the study of four separable but not unrelated functional domains for which subject differences associated with lucid dreaming, or lucidity, have been found. These functional domains are (1) oculomotor/equilibratory; (2) visual/imaginal; (3) intellectual/creative, and (4) personal/interpersonal. The extent of individual differences in lucid dreaming and the methods by which these differences have been investigated will also be discussed. Because methodology is an integral part of research into individual differences, methodological considerations will first be presented."

Rather, by techniques described by Dr. Hobson and others, lucidity can be induced in association with dreams that would otherwise be single-minded. In turn, this means that lucidity must originate from specific brain processes. Early imaging studies showed low levels of frontal lobe neural activity during REM sleep, suggesting that the mechanism for lucidity might be at least partly localized to that area. This hypothesis is bolstered by reports of dream-like mentation during wakefulness in patients with frontal lobe injury."

10.4101/jvwr.v11i2.7249,Dreaming the Virtual: How Lucid Dream Practice Can Inform VR Development,"Using the grounded theory method (GTM), this article proposes an “integral” model for studying the development and use of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies. Integral models seek holistic understanding by combining third-person, empirical perspectives with first-person, subjective experience. Here, the proposed model provides a comparative analysis of immersive virtual reality (VR) platforms and the practice of lucid dreaming (maintaining conscious self-awareness while dreaming). Based on a discursive analysis of technologists’ statements about VR, and a review of literature on lucid dreaming, this article identifies a largely unexamined area of research. Indeed, the proposed model suggests that dream research is highly relevant to VR development as a catalyst for ethical critique of emerging commercial technologies. Though informed by Buddhist philosophy, this is primarily a secular approach based in moral-developmental psychology and contemplative studies. It constitutes an example of Contemplative Media Studies, which involves the application of contemplative practices and principles to the critical analysis of media technologies, content, and institutions."

In recent years, dream lucidity has started to attract more attention not only from the broad neuroscience field but also from applied neurology, psychiatry, sports performance science, or art therapy areas. The aim of this research is to investigate and evaluate some of the therapeutic potentials of dream lucidity. The findings propose that the emergence of self-awareness during sleep could have various health and wellness benefits and applications. Analysis and evaluation of existing neuroscientific data on lucid dreaming was performed and combined with own investigations and methodological insights. In addition, virtual reality training and transcranial direct current stimulation areas of research were also investigated in the context of potential applications for inducing dream lucidity. Results show that various clinical and non-clinical applications of lucid dreaming techniques might be effectively employed in reducing nightmares, increasing mindfulness, or as an experimental treatment for individuals suffering from certain mental health disorders like narcolepsy or post-traumatic stress disorder. It’s further suggested that dream lucidity training might help with sleep quality while reducing daytime stress and anxiety. Nevertheless, further research and caution in this area are required to fully understand both the therapeutic benefits and potentially negative long term consequences of cultivating lucid dreaming."

While basal aspects of consciousness like perceptions and emotions are present in many states and species, higher-order aspects like reflective or volitional capabilities seem to be most pronounced in awake humans. Here we assess the experience of volition across different states of consciousness: 10 frequent lucid dreamers rated different aspects of volition according to the Volitional Components Questionnaire for phases of normal dreaming, lucid dreaming, and wakefulness. Overall, experienced volition was comparable for lucid dreaming and wakefulness, and rated significantly higher for both states compared to non-lucid dreaming. However, three subscales showed specific differences across states of consciousness: planning ability was most pronounced during wakefulness, intention enactment most pronounced during lucid dreaming, and self-determination most pronounced during both wakefulness and lucid dreaming. Our data confirm the multifaceted nature of consciousness: different higher-order aspects of consciousness are differentially expressed across different conscious states."

Such  a  task  grows  even  more  complex  as  one  turns  to  recollection  of  so  called  lucid  dreams.  The  article  covers  different types of messages published on the Dream Hackers forum. That  online community is the largest Russian-language platform for publishing  such  texts.  The  dream-hackers  believe  that  it  is  possible  to  control  the  dreams,  create  maps  of  the  dreamed  places  and  objects  common  for  different dreamers and jointly experience dream plots. Among the stories  of  the  forum  participants  one  may  find  the  stories  about  the  so-called  “talismans”, or, the specific objects that can be transferred from the dream  to  the  material  world,  as  well  as  the  mentions  of  the  different  marks  left  on the body of a dreamer after waking up, such as scratches, wounds etc.  Such beliefs blur the line between the dreaming and the wakefulness and  question the credibility of the reality itself. Furthermore, the article analyzes the basic functions of the mapping  of “lucid  dreams”  mapping.  The  most  important  of  the  functions  is  to  increase  the  “awareness”,  in  other  words,  to  achieve  the  key  state  of  consciousness for the dream hackers."

The aim of this study was to describe and model neurophysiological evidence for the seven awareness criteria of lucid dreaming based on those proposed by Paul Tholey. Each of the awareness criteria was analyzed separately with regard to its underlying neurocircuits. We hypothesized that not one, but several regions are involved in the state of lucid dreaming. Our results have shown a satisfactory overlap of the awareness criteria and the brain regions activated. During lucid dreaming, a brain network seems to emerge, that is something other than the sum of its parts. Further research is needed to understand the psychoneurological underpinnings of lucid dreams."

The frequency of lucid dream in the 2-week diary period was lower than the retrospectively estimated lucid dream frequency. Whereas the negative association between lucid dream frequency and agreeableness was reported previously, the negative correlation between lucid dream frequency and neuroticism is a new finding. Furthermore, the exploratory analysis showed that a considerable number of lucid dreams did not include some form of dream control. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to study the relationship between personality, especially neuroticism and agreeableness, and lucid dreaming in a more detailed way. "

This empirical study aimed to explore the relationship between lucid dreaming and spirituality, taking into account the role of mystical lucid dream experience, in an online sample of 471 respondents, 95% of whom had lucid dream experience and 65% were frequent lucid dreamers. The findings support the relationship between lucid dreaming and spirituality: spiritual transcendence was positively associated with both lucid dream frequency and mystical lucid dream experiences. Thus having recurrent lucid dreams and mystical experiences in them may foster spiritual growth, rendering lucid dreaming possibly a viable spiritual practice, especially within the secular context. However, the correlative nature of the present research does not imply causality and further longitudinal research confirming this is needed."

                  Introduction
                  Nightmares can cause poorer sleep quality. Various mechanisms have been explored as potential treatments for nightmares, including mindfulness practices and lucid dreaming. Presently, little literature has looked at the interaction effects between mindfulness and lucid dreaming to reduce nightmare distress.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A sample of 275 individuals was recruited from both the United States and Thailand via social media and a student pool of research subjects at UNC Charlotte. Data were recorded on participants’ demographic information, lucid dreaming from the Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams Scale (Voss et al., 2013), Mindfulness using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionaire (Baer et al., 2006), Nighmares via the Nightmare Distress Questionaire (Belicki, 1992), and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989). Higher scores on each measure were associated with more lucid dreaming, more mindful behaviors, more severe nightmares, and poorer sleep quality. PROCESS model 8 was run to conduct a moderated mediation analysis (Hayes, 2018). Lucid dreaming was used as the predictor; sleep quality as the outcome variable, nightmare distress as the mediator and mindfulness acted as a moderator on both the direct and indirect pathway of lucid dreaming onto the mediator and outcome.
               
               
                  Results
                  Mindfulness was a significant predictor at both the mediator and outcome variables. Nightmare distress was a significant predictor of sleep quality. A statistical trend (p=.054) suggests lucid dreaming may have a positive effect on nightmare distress. In the indirect path, lucid dreaming had a positive effect on PSQI scores only for individuals with low mindfulness.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The moderated mediation suggests that individuals with low mindfulness may see a decrease in sleep quality from lucid dreaming. This could be due to lucid dreaming being associated with more severe nightmares. A zero-effect size could not be ruled out of the confidence intervals for individuals of average or high mindfulness, but the data suggest that lucid dreaming alone may not help treat nightmares, but the combination of lucid dreaming and mindfulness therapies could promote lower distress and better sleep quality.

Becoming lucid (realizing that one is dreaming) during a nightmare allows one to alter the nightmare storyline during the nightmare itself. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; After having filled out a sleep and a posttraumatic stress disorder questionnaire, 23 nightmare sufferers were randomly divided into 3 groups; 8 participants received one 2-hour individual LDT session, 8 participants received one 2-hour group LDT session, and 7 participants were placed on the waiting list. LDT consisted of exposure, mastery, and lucidity exercises. Participants filled out the same questionnaires 12 weeks after the intervention (follow-up). &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; At follow-up the nightmare frequency of both treatment groups had decreased. There were no significant changes in sleep quality and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity. Lucidity was not necessary for a reduction in nightmare frequency. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; LDT seems effective in reducing nightmare frequency, although the primary therapeutic component (i.e. exposure, mastery, or lucidity) remains unclear."

               In lucid dreams the dreamer is aware that he or she is dreaming. Although such dreams are not that uncommon, many aspects of lucid dream phenomenology are still unclear. An online survey was conducted to gather data about lucid dream origination, duration, active or passive participation in the dream, planned actions for lucid dreams, and other phenomenological aspects. Among the 684 respondents who filled out the questionnaire, there were 571 lucid dreamers (83.5%). According to their reports, lucid dreams most often originate spontaneously in adolescence. The average lucid dream duration is about 14 minutes. Lucid dreamers are likely to be active in their lucid dreams and plan to accomplish different actions (e.g., flying, talking with dream characters, or having sex), yet they are not always able to remember or successfully execute their intentions (most often because of awakening or hindrances in the dream environment). The frequency of lucid dream experience was the strongest predictor of lucid dream phenomenology, but some differences were also observed in relation to age, gender, or whether the person is a natural or self-trained lucid dreamer. The findings are discussed in light of lucid dream research, and suggestions for future studies are provided."
10.1177/003151259508100258,Lucid Dreaming and Control in Waking Life," In a survey of 17 middle-school students, search for control over situations in waking life was positively correlated with frequency of lucid dreaming. "
10.2466/pms.1989.68.2.567,Consciousness and Abilities of Dream Characters Observed during Lucid Dreaming," A description of several phenomenological experiments is given. These were done to investigate of which cognitive accomplishments dream characters are capable in lucid dreams. Nine male experienced lucid dreamers participated as subjects. They were directed to set different tasks to dream characters they met while lucid dreaming. Dream characters were asked to draw or write, to name unknown words, to find rhyme words, to make verses, and to solve arithmetic problems. Part of the dream characters actually agreed to perform the tasks and were successful, although the arithmetic accomplishments were poor. From the phenomenological findings, nothing contradicts the assumption that dream characters have consciousness in a specific sense. Herefrom the conclusion was drawn, that in lucid dream therapy communication with dream characters should be handled as if they were rational beings. Finally, several possibilities of assessing the question, whether dream characters possess consciousness, can be examined with the aid of psychophysiological experiments. "

The idea that dreaming is a kind of warming up of consciousness for the demands of the day is consistent with the fact that REM sleep usually does not start until 90&nbsp;min after falling asleep, and REM periods increase in length from 10&nbsp;min at the beginning of the sleep cycle to an hour toward morning. Loss of REM sleep adversely affects daytime consciousness more than does loss of nonREM sleep. Depriving animals of REM sleep for several weeks leads to their death. Salient to Hobson’s theory is the fact that the percentage of sleep devoted to REM activity is highest in infancy and childhood, even controlling for the fact that infants and children sleep longer than do adults. So as consciousness is growing and developing, REM activity is stirring it up. So perhaps dreaming is something akin to running the engine to start a balky car when the engine is cold – revving it up to catch and run normally."

The purpose of the present communication is to discuss two major concepts in dreaming and psychosis that have received much attention in the recent literature: insight and dissociation. Both phenomena are considered functions of higher order consciousness because they involve metacognition in the form of reflective thought and attempted control of negative emotional impact. Insight in dreams is a core criterion for lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are usually accompanied by attempts to control the dream plot and dissociative elements akin to depersonalization and derealization. These concepts are also relevant in psychotic illness. Whereas insightfulness can be considered innocuous in lucid dreaming and even advantageous in psychosis, the concept of dissociation is still unresolved. The present review compares correlates and functions of insight and dissociation in lucid dreaming and psychosis. This is helpful in understanding the two concepts with regard to psychological function as well as neurophysiology."
10.3390/clockssleep2010007,Lucid Dreaming and the Feeling of Being Refreshed in the Morning: A Diary Study,"REM periods with lucid dreaming show increased brain activation, especially in the prefrontal cortex, compared to REM periods without lucid dreaming and, thus, the question of whether lucid dreaming interferes with the recovery function of sleep arises. Cross-sectional studies found a negative relationship between sleep quality and lucid dreaming frequency, but this relationship was explained by nightmare frequency. The present study included 149 participants keeping a dream diary for five weeks though the course of a lucid dream induction study. The results clearly indicate that there is no negative effect of having a lucid dream on the feeling of being refreshed in the morning compared to nights with the recall of a non-lucid dream; on the contrary, the feeling of being refreshed was higher after a night with a lucid dream. Future studies should be carried out to elicit tiredness and sleepiness during the day using objective and subjective measurement methods."

During the 3-yr. study, the subject recorded a total of 389 lucid dreams and developed a mnemonic technique for the voluntary induction of lucid dreams (MILD). Without using any induction procedure, the subject reported less than 1 lucid dream per month. Using auto-suggestion resulted in a range of 1 to 13 lucid dreams per month ( M = 5.4), with at most 2 per night. MILD yielded 18 to 26 lucid dreams per month ( M = 21.5), with up to 4 per night. "

The present study investigated the question as to whether sensory processing sensitivity is related to lucid dreaming. Overall, 1,807 persons (1,008 woman, 799 men) with a mean age of 47.75 ± 14.41 years completed the German High Sensitive Person Scale, a Big Five personality inventory, and the lucid dream frequency scale. As expected, Aesthetic Sensitivity and Low Sensory Threshold (two of the three sensory processing factors) were positively related to lucid dream frequency. Moreover, extraversion and low agreeableness were also related to lucid dreaming frequency. Although the effect sizes of these relationships are relatively small, this research can shed light on the mechanism underlying the inter-individual differences in lucid dream frequency. "

10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01826,Cognitions in Sleep: Lucid Dreaming as an Intervention for Nightmares in Patients With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Frontier's About 80% of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients suffer from nightmares or dysphoric dreams that cause major distress and impact nighttime or daytime functioning. Lucid dreaming (LD) is a learnable and effective strategy to cope with nightmares and has positive effects on other sleep variables. In LDs, the dreamer is aware of the dreaming state and able to control the dream content. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of lucid dreaming therapy (LDT) in patients suffering from PTSD. We suggest that learning a technique that enables the affected subjects to regulate the occurrence and content of nightmares autonomously increases the chance of coping with the complex symptoms of PTSD and can reduce suffering. Sleep quality (PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), daytime sleepiness (ESS, Epworth Sleepiness Scale), quality of life (MQLI, Multicultural Quality of Life Index), psychological distress (SCL-90-R, Symptom Checklist 90-Revised), distress caused by traumatic events (IE-S, Impact of Events Scale), anxiety (SAS, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depression (SDS, Self-Rating Depression Scale), and nightmare severity were assessed in a self-rating questionnaire before and after the intervention. LDT had no effect on the investigated sleep variables. No correlation between reduction of nightmare severity and changes in PTSD-profile (IE-S) was found. Nevertheless, levels of anxiety and depression decreased significantly in the course of therapy. LDT could provide an alternate or complementary treatment option for nightmares in PTSD, specifically for symptoms of anxiety and depression."

10.2466/09.pms.112.1.104-108,Frequency of Lucid Dreaming in a Representative German Sample," Lucid dreams occur when a person is aware that he is dreaming while he is dreaming. In a representative sample of German adults ( N = 919), 51% of the participants reported that they had experienced a lucid dream at least once. Lucid dream recall was significantly higher in women and negatively correlated with age. However, these effects might be explained by the frequency of dream recall, as there was a correlation of .57 between frequency of dream recall and frequency of lucid dreams. Other sociodemographic variables like education, marital status, or monthly income were not related to lucid dream frequency. Given the relatively high prevalence of lucid dreaming reported in the present study, research on lucid dreams might be pursued in the sleep laboratory to expand the knowledge about sleep, dreaming, and consciousness processes in general. "
10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00384,"Lucid Dreaming: Intensity, But Not Frequency, Is Inversely Related to Psychopathology","Frontier's Lucid dreaming (LD) is awareness that one is dreaming, during the dream state. However, some define and assess LD relying also on controlling dream events, although control is present only in a subset of lucid dreams. LD has been claimed to represent well-being, and has even been used as a therapeutic agent. Conversely, LD is associated with mixed sleep-wake states, which are related to bizarre cognitions, stress, and psychopathology, and have been construed as arousal permeating and disrupting sleep. We propose that previous conflicting findings regarding relations between LD and both psychopathology and well-being, stem from the non-differentiated assessment of frequency and control. The present study aimed to develop an expansive measure of several LD characteristics (the Frequency and Intensity Lucid Dream questionnaire; FILD), and explore their relations with symptomatology. Undergraduate students (N = 187) self-reported trait LD, psychopathology (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation, and schizotypy), stress, and sleep problems; 2 months later, a subsample (n = 78) reported psychopathology again, and also completed a dream diary each morning for 14 days. Preliminary evidence supports the reliability and validity of the FILD. Items converged into four domains: frequency, intensity (e.g., control, activity, certainty of dreaming), emotional valence, and the use of induction techniques. We report an optimal frequency cutoff score to identify those likely to experience LD within a 2-week period. Whereas LD frequency was unrelated to psychopathology, LD intensity, and positive LD emotions, were inversely associated with several psychopathological symptoms. Use of deliberate induction techniques was positively associated with psychopathology and sleep problems. Additionally, we demonstrated directionality by employing a prospective-longitudinal design, showing that deliberate LD induction predicted an increase in dissociation and schizotypy symptoms across 2 months. We conclude that lucidity should not be considered as necessarily suggestive of well-being; LD may be positive or negative, depending on lucidity characteristics. Additionally, deliberate LD induction may harbor negative long-term risk."

The study comprised a UK-based online sample of 455 respondents (110 males, 345 females, Mean age = 34.46 years, SD = 15.70), who had all previously experienced lucid dreaming. Respondents completed established self-report measures assessing control within lucid dreaming, experience and frequency of nightmares, incidence of sleep paralysis, proneness to reality testing deficits (Inventory of Personality Organization subscale, IPO-RT), subjective experience of receptive psi and life after death (paranormal experience), and paranormal belief. Analysis comprised tests of correlational and predictive relationships between sleep-related outcomes, IPO-RT scores, and paranormal measures. Significant positive correlations between sleep and paranormal measures were weak. Paranormal measures related differentially to sleep indices. Paranormal experience correlated with lucid dreaming, nightmares, and sleep paralysis, whereas paranormal belief related only to nightmares and sleep paralysis. IPO-RT correlated positively with all paranormal and sleep-related measures. Within the IPO-RT, the Auditory and Visual Hallucinations sub-factor demonstrated the strongest positive associations with sleep measures. Structural equation modeling indicated that Auditory and Visual Hallucinations significantly positively predicted dissociated experiences related to REM sleep, while paranormal experience did not. However, paranormal experience was a significant predictor when analysis controlled for Auditory and Visual Hallucinations. The moderate positive association between these variables explained this effect. Findings indicated that self-generated, productive cognitive-processes (as encompassed by Auditory and Visual Hallucinations) played a significant role in conscious control and awareness of lucid dreaming, and related dissociative sleep states (sleep paralysis and nightmares)."
10.1177/0276236616648653,Lucid Dreaming Frequency and the Big Five Personality Factors," Lucid dreaming frequency varies strongly among individuals and, thus, research has focused on identifying what factors affect this phenomenon. The present study, an online survey ( N = 2,492), focused on the relationship between the Big Five personality dimensions and lucid dreaming frequency. Additionally, the personality correlates of the age of the first lucid dream were investigated. In our sample, a small but substantial portion of individual differences concerning lucid dreaming frequency was explained by the Big Five personality factors. Openness to experiences correlated positively with lucid dreaming frequency, whereas the correlation was negative for agreeableness. The relationship between neuroticism and lucid dreaming frequency disappeared when nightmare frequency was controlled. Future researchers should examine the relationship of the Big Five factors with the attitudes toward and the contents of lucid dreams. Moreover, longitudinal studies should investigate the lucid dream socialization of children and the effect of age on the course of interest in lucid dreaming. "

                  Study Objectives
                  (1) To critically test whether a previously reported increase in frontolateral 40 Hz power in lucid REM sleep, used to justify the claim that lucid dreaming is a “hybrid state” mixing sleep and wakefulness, is attributable to the saccadic spike potential (SP) artifact as a corollary of heightened REM density. (2) To replicate the finding that lucid dreams are associated with physiological activation, including heightened eye movement density, during REM sleep. (3) To conduct an exploratory analysis of changes in EEG features during lucid REM sleep
               
               
                  Methods
                  We analyzed 14 signal-verified lucid dreams (SVLDs) and baseline REM sleep segments from the same REM periods from six participants derived from the Stanford SVLD database. Participants marked lucidity onset with standard left-right-left-right-center (LR2c) eye-movement signals in polysomnography recordings.
               
               
                  Results
                  Compared to baseline REM sleep, lucid REM sleep had higher REM density (β = 0.85, p = 0.002). Bayesian analysis supported the null hypothesis of no differences in frontolateral 40 Hz power after removal of the SP artifact (BH = 0.18) and ICA correction (BH = 0.01). Compared to the entire REM sleep period, lucid REM sleep showed small reductions in low-frequency and beta band spectral power as well as increased signal complexity (all p &amp;lt; 0.05), which were within the normal variance of baseline REM sleep.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Lucid dreams are associated with higher-than-average levels of physiological activation during REM sleep, including measures of both subcortical and cortical activation. Increases in 40 Hz power in periorbital channels reflect saccadic and microsaccadic SPs as a result of higher REM density accompanying heightened activation.

10.3389/fnhum.2014.00717,"Tickle me, I think I might be dreaming! Sensory attenuation, self-other distinction, and predictive processing in lucid dreams","Frontier's The contrast between self- and other-produced tickles, as a special case of sensory attenuation for self-produced actions, has long been a target of empirical research. While in standard wake states it is nearly impossible to tickle oneself, there are interesting exceptions. Notably, participants awakened from REM (rapid eye movement-) sleep dreams are able to tickle themselves. So far, however, the question of whether it is possible to tickle oneself and be tickled by another in the dream state has not been investigated empirically or addressed from a theoretical perspective. Here, we report the results of an explorative web-based study in which participants were asked to rate their sensations during self-tickling and being tickled during wakefulness, imagination, and lucid dreaming. Our results, though highly preliminary, indicate that in the special case of lucid control dreams, the difference between self-tickling and being tickled by another is obliterated, with both self- and other produced tickles receiving similar ratings as self-tickling during wakefulness. This leads us to the speculative conclusion that in lucid control dreams, sensory attenuation for self-produced tickles spreads to those produced by non-self dream characters. These preliminary results provide the backdrop for a more general theoretical and metatheoretical discussion of tickling in lucid dreams in a predictive processing framework. We argue that the primary value of our study lies not so much in our results, which are subject to important limitations, but rather in the fact that they enable a new theoretical perspective on the relationship between sensory attenuation, the self-other distinction and agency, as well as suggest new questions for future research. In particular, the example of tickling during lucid dreaming raises the question of whether sensory attenuation and the self-other distinction can be simulated largely independently of external sensory input."

10.1177/0276236615572594,Meta-Awareness During Day and Night," The present study explored the relationship between lucidity in dreams (awareness of dreams while dreaming) and mindfulness during wakefulness, also considering meditation as a possible moderating variable. An online survey was completed by 528 respondents, of whom 386 (73.1%) had lucid dream experiences. The reported frequency of lucid dreams was found to be positively related to higher dispositional mindfulness in wakefulness. This relationship was only present in those participants who reported acquaintance with meditation. Regarding the dimensions of mindfulness, lucid dream frequency was more strongly associated with mindful presence rather than acceptance. The findings support the notion of an existing relationship between lucidity in dreams and mindfulness during wakefulness, yet it remains unclear whether the relationship is influenced by actual meditation practice or whether it reflects some natural predispositions. Future studies should examine the role of different meditation practices, investigate personality variables that might influence the relationship, and explore how different facets of mindfulness and lucidity interrelate.

10.1093/sleep/zsaa056.110,0112 Lucid Dreaming Associated with Positive Waking Mood,"Abstract
               
                  Introduction
                  Lucid dreaming (being aware that one is dreaming) is typically a positive experience that may enhance positive mood even after waking. There is concern, however, that lucid dreaming may interfere with sleep quality. In the current experiment, participants practiced common lucid dream induction techniques over the course of a week, and kept a daily sleep and dream diary. The study objective was to assess relationships between dream lucidity and subjective sleep quality, dream emotional content, and subsequent waking mood.
               
               
                  Methods
                  There were 32 participants aged 19–33 in this open label, single arm study (mean=22.63±3.48; 6 males, 24 females). All participants completed a sleep and dream diary for 7 days that included scaled items (1–7 scale) concerning subjective sleep quality, negative and positive emotional intensity of a dream (if recalled). Participants also completed a 19-item lucidity questionnaire, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Average scores for the week were computed for all measures and Pearson’s correlations conducted between lucidity and all other measures. Participants with no dream recall (n=5) were excluded. Within-subjects analyses were undertaken by selecting each participant’s highest and lowest lucidity night (n=22; 5 participants with only minimum lucidity excluded).
               
               
                  Results
                  Positive correlations were found between lucidity and dream positive emotion (r=.490, n=27, p=.009) and positive waking mood (r=.638, n=27, p&amp;lt;.001); there were no other significant correlations (all p&amp;gt;.1). Higher lucidity was associated with more positive dream content (t(21)= -3.214, p=.004) and positive waking mood (t(25)=-4.568, p&amp;lt;.001); no other significant differences were observed.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  These data indicate that lucidity is associated with positive dreams and waking mood, with no detriment to self-reported sleep quality. The findings provide preliminary support of lucid dreaming as an intervention to improve wellbeing and mood in the short term.

10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02618,"My Dream, My Rules: Can Lucid Dreaming Treat Nightmares?","Frontier's Nightmares are defined as repeated occurrences of extremely dysphoric and well-remembered dreams that usually involve subjective threats to survival, security, or physical integrity. Generally, they occur during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and lead to awakenings with distress and insufficient overnight sleep. Nightmares may occur spontaneously (idiopathic) or as recurrent nightmares. Recurrent nightmares cause significant distress and impairment in occupational and social functioning, as have been commonly observed in post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. By contrast, during lucid dreaming (LD), subjects get insight they are dreaming and may even control the content of their dreams. These features may open a way to help those who suffer from nightmare disorder through re-significations of the dream scene, i.e., knowing that they are dreaming and having control over their dream content. Thus, lucid dreamers might be able to render nightmares normal dreams, thereby assuring a restoring sleep. The aim of the present study is to review the existing literature of the use of LD as an auxiliary tool for treatment of nightmares. We conducted a careful literature search for eligible studies on the use of LD treatment for nightmares. We observed that whereas LD may be a feasible aid in the treatment of patients with nightmares through minimizing their frequency, intensity and psychological distress, the available literature is still scarce and does not provide consistent results. We conclude therefore that more research is clearly warranted for a better estimation of the effective conductance and therapeutic outcome of LD treatment in clinical practice."
10.3389/fnhum.2013.00836,Dream characteristics in a Brazilian sample: an online survey focusing on lucid dreaming,"Frontier's During sleep, humans experience the offline images and sensations that we call dreams, which are typically emotional and lacking in rational judgment of their bizarreness. However, during lucid dreaming (LD), subjects know that they are dreaming, and may control oneiric content. Dreaming and LD features have been studied in North Americans, Europeans and Asians, but not among Brazilians, the largest population in Latin America. Here we investigated dreams and LD characteristics in a Brazilian sample (n = 3,427; median age = 25 years) through an online survey. The subjects reported recalling dreams at least once a week (76%), and that dreams typically depicted actions (93%), known people (92%), sounds/voices (78%), and colored images (76%). The oneiric content was associated with plans for the upcoming days (37%), memories of the previous day (13%), or unrelated to the dreamer (30%). Nightmares usually depicted anxiety/fear (65%), being stalked (48%), or other unpleasant sensations (47%). These data corroborate Freudian notion of day residue in dreams, and suggest that dreams and nightmares are simulations of life situations that are related to our psychobiological integrity. Regarding LD, we observed that 77% of the subjects experienced LD at least once in life (44% up to 10 episodes ever), and for 48% LD subjectively lasted less than 1 min. LD frequency correlated weakly with dream recall frequency (r = 0.20, p &lt; 0.01), and LD control was rare (29%). LD occurrence was facilitated when subjects did not need to wake up early (38%), a situation that increases rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) duration, or when subjects were under stress (30%), which increases REMS transitions into waking. These results indicate that LD is relatively ubiquitous but rare, unstable, difficult to control, and facilitated by increases in REMS duration and transitions to wake state. Together with LD incidence in USA, Europe and Asia, our data from Latin America strengthen the notion that LD is a general phenomenon of the human species."

In this correlational study, the sample comprised of 220 young Pakistani adults from both genders (124 women and 96 men) age range from 18 to 26 years (M = 21.14, SD = 1.87). The participants were assessed on nightmares, psychosis proneness, and lucid dreaming through the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire, Inventory of Personality Organization, and The Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams Scale respectively. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated significant inter-correlation between dream lucidity, nightmare, and psychosis proneness. Path analysis illustrated dream lucidity as a significant mediator in the link between nightmare and psychosis proneness. The results concluded that dream lucidity plays the role of facilitating factor in the development of psychosis proneness. The findings also provide insight into the role of nightmares and lucid dreaming while examining psychosis proneness."
10.1073/pnas.2123418119,"Predictive coding, multisensory integration, and attentional control: A multicomponent framework for lucid dreaming","Lucid dreaming (LD) is a mental state in which we realize not being awake but are dreaming while asleep. It often involves vivid, perceptually intense dream images as well as peculiar kinesthetic sensations, such as flying, levitating, or out-of-body experiences. LD is in the cross-spotlight of cognitive neuroscience and sleep research as a particular case to study consciousness, cognition, and the neural background of dream experiences. Here, we present a multicomponent framework for the study and understanding of neurocognitive mechanisms and phenomenological aspects of LD. We propose that LD is associated with prediction error signals arising during sleep and occurring at higher or lower levels of the processing hierarchy. Prediction errors are resolved by generating a superordinate self-model able to integrate ambiguous stimuli arriving from sensory periphery and higher-order cortical regions. While multisensory integration enables lucidity maintenance and contributes to peculiar kinesthetic experiences, attentional control facilitates multisensory integration by dynamically regulating the balance between the influence of top-down mental models and the precision weighting of bottom-up sensory inputs. Our novel framework aims to link neural correlates of LD with current concepts of sleep and arousal regulation and provide testable predictions on interindividual differences in LD as well as neurocognitive mechanisms inducing lucid dreams."

10.2466/pms.1982.55.3.795,Lucid Dreaming and Alpha Activity: A Preliminary Report," 10 good dream recallers spent 2 nights in the sleep lab during which they were awakened 4 times per night from REM sleep, twice during their highest alpha activity in REM, and twice during low REM alpha. 5 were given alpha feedback training prior to sleep onset. Arousals from high alpha REM sleep yielded significantly higher lucidity ratings. Alpha feedback had no effect upon lucidity or REM alpha levels. Similarities between lucid dreams and meditative phenomena are discussed. "
10.2466/pms.1981.52.3.727,Lucid Dreaming Verified by Volitional Communication during Rem Sleep," The occurrence of lucid dreaming (dreaming while being conscious that one is dreaming) has been verified for 5 selected subjects who signaled that they knew they were dreaming while continuing to dream during unequivocal REM sleep. The signals consisted of particular dream actions having observable concomitants and were performed in accordance with pre-sleep agreement. The ability of proficient lucid dreamers to signal in this manner makes possible a new approach to dream research—such subjects, while lucid, could carry out diverse dream experiments marking the exact time of particular dream events, allowing derivation of precise psychophysiological correlations and methodical testing of hypotheses.

10.1038/s41467-018-05547-0,Smooth tracking of visual targets distinguishes lucid REM sleep dreaming and waking perception from imagination,"AbstractHumans are typically unable to engage in sustained smooth pursuit for imagined objects. However, it is unknown to what extent smooth tracking occurs for visual imagery during REM sleep dreaming. Here we examine smooth pursuit eye movements during tracking of a slow-moving visual target during lucid dreams in REM sleep. Highly similar smooth pursuit tracking was observed during both waking perception and lucid REM sleep dreaming, in contrast to the characteristically saccadic tracking observed during visuomotor imagination. Our findings suggest that, in this respect, the visual imagery that occurs during REM sleep is more similar to perception than imagination. The data also show that the neural circuitry of smooth pursuit can be driven by a visual percept in the absence of retinal stimulation and that specific voluntary shifts in the direction of experienced gaze within REM sleep dreams are accompanied by corresponding rotations of the physical eyes."

10.1007/s11263-019-01164-6,Lucid Data Dreaming for Video Object Segmentation,"Convolutional networks reach top quality in pixel-level video object segmentation but require a large amount of training data (1k–100k) to deliver such results. We propose a new training strategy which achieves state-of-the-art results across three evaluation datasets while using 20\,\times 20\,\times –1000\,\times 1000\,\times  less annotated data than competing methods. Our approach is suitable for both single and multiple object segmentation. Instead of using large training sets hoping to generalize across domains, we generate in-domain training data using the provided annotation on the first frame of each video to synthesize—“lucid dream” (in a lucid dream the sleeper is aware that he or she is dreaming and is sometimes able to control the course of the dream)—plausible future video frames. In-domain per-video training data allows us to train high quality appearance- and motion-based models, as well as tune the post-processing stage. This approach allows to reach competitive results even when training from only a single annotated frame, without ImageNet pre-training. Our results indicate that using a larger training set is not automatically better, and that for the video object segmentation task a smaller training set that is closer to the target domain is more effective. This changes the mindset regarding how many training samples and general “objectness” knowledge are required for the video object segmentation task."

Although lucid dreams are clearly toward one end of the continuum, they still share many of the characteristics present in most dreams. In this respect, exploration of lucid dreams may not necessarily be a misguided path toward the understanding of dreaming in general. A simple model was described to illustrate the mind-body relationship in various forms of REM dreaming. "
10.3389/fpsyg.2020.555731,The Dream of God: How Do Religion and Science See Lucid Dreaming and Other Conscious States During Sleep?,"Frontier's Lucid dreaming (LD) began to be scientifically studied in the last century, but various religions have highlighted the importance of LD in their doctrines for a much longer period. Hindus’ manuscripts dating back over 2,000 years ago, for example, divide consciousness in waking, dreaming (including LD), and deep sleep. In the Buddhist tradition, Tibetan monks have been practicing the “Dream Yoga,” a meditation technique that instructs dreamers to recognize the dream, overcome all fears when lucid, and control the oneiric content. In the Islamic sacred scriptures, LD is regarded as a mental state of great value, and a special way for the initiated to reach mystical experiences. The Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) mentions LD as a kind of preview of the afterlife, when the soul separates from the body. In the nineteenth century, some branches of the Spiritism religion argue that LD precedes out-of-body experiences during sleep. Here we reviewed how these religions interpret dreams, LD and other conscious states during sleep. We observed that while Abrahamic monotheisms (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) recognize dreams as a way to communicate with God to understand the present and predict the future, the traditional Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) are more engaged in cultivating self-awareness, thus developed specific techniques to induce LD and witnessing sleep. Teachings from religious traditions around the world offer important insights for scientific researchers today who want to understand the full range of LD phenomenology as it has emerged through history."

In this article, I look at the recent interest in alternative therapies by the U.S. military, which has explored the possibilities of lucid dreaming in order to help soldiers cope with the adverse mental and emotional effects of combat—commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this context of concerns about effective rehabilitation and the cost of veteran care, I examine the popular science fiction films Avatar and Inception, which have been discussed in the media as illustrations of the potential use of lucid dreaming and digitally created virtual worlds to “heal” the minds of soldiers affected by modern warfare. In these media portrayals, psychology and science fiction come together to envision and promote human-machine fantasies of the endlessly salvageable and, therefore ultimately, invincible American soldier.

10.1038/s41598-022-19624-4,The role of mindful acceptance and lucid dreaming in nightmare frequency and distress,"AbstractA theoretical and empirical association between lucid dreaming and mindfulness, as well as lucid dreaming and nightmares has previously been observed; however, the relationship between nightmares and mindfulness has received surprisingly little attention. Here, we present the findings of two studies exploring the relation of nightmare frequency and distress with two components of mindfulness, termed presence and acceptance, as well as lucid dreaming. Study 1 (N = 338) consisted of a low percentage of frequent lucid dreamers whereas Study 2 (N = 187) consisted primarily of frequent lucid dreamers that used lucid dream induction training techniques and meditation. Across studies, nightmare-related variables showed a more robust association with mindful acceptance as opposed to mindful presence. Moreover, individuals with high levels of meditation expertise and practice of lucid dreaming induction techniques reported lower nightmare frequency. Finally, in Study 2, which consisted of frequent lucid dreamers, a positive correlation between lucid dreaming frequency and mindfulness was apparent. The present findings support the notion that wakeful mindfulness is associated with the quality of dreams and extend previous research by suggesting a disentangled role of the two facets of mindfulness in dream variation. This association remains open for experimental manipulation, the result of which could have clinical implications.

As the basic tenets of Realism became increasingly challenged by Modernist questioning, chinoiserie ‘absurdities’ offered the Modernist artist escape from Realism’s transcriptively referential constraints. The term has historically been confined to the decorative arts and critically overlooked as a somewhat moribund style. As a consequence, the continuities between chinoiserie and its role in Modernist ways of looking or seeing have been paid little attention. The introduction will suggest a new theoretical attention to chinoiserie as crucial to the re-visioning of the Modernist eye."

10.11588/ijodr.2020.1.71695,Lucid dream induction by auditory stimulation and reality testing during early-morning sleep,"One challenge in lucid dream research executed in a laboratory setting is the reliable induction of lucid dreams. A possible way to solve this issue is the combination of already known and effective induction techniques (Stumbrys, Erlacher, Schädlich, &amp; Schredl, 2012). The present study combines the wake-up-back-to-bed sleep protocol (WBTB) with reality testing and acoustic stimulation by music. The following question was posed: would repeating the same music presented during the waking dream work session during the subsequent REM sleep increase the chance of a lucid dream experience. In total 21 participants spent a single night in the sleep lab. The whole procedure induced in 3 participants a lucid dream (14.3%), however none of those lucid dreams were verified by LRLR eye signal. The success rate of a combination of auditory stimulation with reality testing thus lies below the success rate of other induction techniques. The incorporation of music as a theme was found in 9 (19.6%) out of 69 dream reports which is in accordance with previously reported incorporation rates. Beside the music presentation, other methodological adjustments were made (e.g., shortening of the first part of the night to 4.5 h), which will be discussed and hopefully help further research to increase lucid dream induction rate."
10.11588/ijodr.2020.1.68010,A pilot investigation into brain-computer interface use during a lucid dream,"During lucid moments of a dream, the sleeper is aware of the dream as it is occurring, and as a result can often perform predetermined actions within the dream. This provides a unique opportunity for dream research, as lucid dreamers can send real-time signals from sleep to the external world. Historically, such sleep-to-wake communication from a lucid dream is executed via left-right eye movements, which places hard limitations on information transfer. Recent advances in biomedical equipment — specifically brain-computer interfaces — have resulted in headsets that use neural recordings to translate mental imagery into computer commands. In light of evidence suggesting that dreamed and imagined actions recruit similar neural resources, I considered the possibility that the same mental commands that are collected and translated from waking imagery could be similarly performed and detected from within a lucid dream. In this exploratory study with proof-of-concept intent, three participants were asked to use an Emotiv EPOC+ headset and companion software to map a mental motor command (pushing a block) with a resulting computer action (graphic of block moving forward). After waking training, participants attempted to induce a lucid dream while wearing the headset, and upon lucidity perform the same mental command. In two participants, subjectively reported lucid dream task completion was corroborated with video footage of the resulting computer graphic. These preliminary results suggest that a wake-trained brain-computer interface can be controlled from sleep and offer important directions for future dream communication and research."

The procedure induced a self-rated lucid dream in five participants compared to one lucid dream in a sham condition. In two cases (16.7%) a signal-verified lucid dream was found. The induction rate of the present study procedure will be discussed in the context of previous studies and success rates of combining reality checking with external stimulation."
