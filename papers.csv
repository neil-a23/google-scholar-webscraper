This state of consciousness opens a new experimental venue for dream research. However, laboratory study in this field is limited due to the rarity of lucid dreamers. In a previous study, we were able to induce in 50% of the participants a lucid dream in a single sleep laboratory night by combining a wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) sleep routine and a mnemonic method (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, MILD). In three experiments, we tried to replicate our earlier findings while we adapted our procedure in shortening (Exp1–3: 4.5 vs. 6 h of uninterrupted sleep in the first half of the night), simplifying (Exp2: time-based wakening vs. REM wakening in the second half of the night), and applying another induction technique (Exp3: reality testing vs. MILD). In the three conditions, four out of 15 (26%), zero out of 20 (0%), and three out of 15 (20%) participants reported a lucid dream. Compared to the original study, the earlier sleep interruption seems to reduce the lucid dream induction rate. Furthermore, without REM awakenings in the morning, lucid dream induction failed, whereas reality testing showed a lower success rate compared to MILD. Further systematic sleep laboratory studies are needed to develop reliable techniques for lucid dream research."

However, laboratory research in this area is limited because frequent lucid dreamers are rare. Several studies demonstrated that different methods of induction could increase the number of lucid dreams. In four field studies, a combination of a wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) sleep protocol and a mnemonic technique (MILD) showed promising results. To further investigate the effectiveness of this combined approach, we conducted a sleep laboratory experiment with four different conditions. The general experimental procedure was the following: Participants were awakened after 6 h of sleep from a subsequent REM period and kept awake for 30 or 60 min, during which they were asked to practice MILD or a control task (e.g., reading). Then they returned to bed for a morning sleep period. In the first condition eleven sport students, who attended a seminar on sleep and dreams, spent one night in a sleep laboratory. To avoid biases due to the seminar attendance (e.g., higher motivation), in the second condition 15 participants who did not attend the seminar were recruited. In the third condition, 14 sport students were tested with a shorter awakening period (30 min). Finally, the fourth condition served as a control condition, whereas eleven sport students slept two non-consecutive nights in a laboratory. Instead of MILD, in one night the participants read a book (fiction, unrelated to dreams), while in the other night they played a Nintendo Wii video game. In the first three conditions, six (54%), eight (53%), and five participants (36%) reported lucid dreams during the morning sleep period, whereas three, (27%), four (27%), and two participants (14%) produced PSG-verified eye signals. In contrast, in the reading condition, only one (9%) participant reported lucid dreams and no eye movements. No lucid dreams were observed in the Wii condition. The findings of the present study show that by using a combination of WBTB and MILD, lucid dreams can be effectively induced in people who are not selected for their lucid dream abilities."
3,10.1016/j.concog.2018.05.012,Exploring the effects of galantamine paired with meditation and dream reliving on recalled dreams: Toward an integrated protocol for lucid dream induction and nightmare resolution.,"An experimental home study examined the impact of a pre-sleep protocol for enhancing self-awareness, lucidity, and responsiveness in dreams. It included ingesting the cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine--which is widely reported to increase the frequency of lucid dreaming--prior to engaging in middle-of-the-night meditation and the imaginary reliving of a distressing dream while exercising new responses. Thirty-five participants completed an eight-night study, which included pre- and post-baseline nights and six conditions: waking for 40 min before returning to bed, called Wake-Back-to-Bed (WBTB); Wake-Back-to-Bed plus placebo (WBTB + P); Wake-Back-to-Bed plus galantamine (WBTB + G); meditation and dream reliving (MDR); meditation and dream reliving plus placebo (MDR + P); and meditation and dream reliving plus galantamine (MDR + G). The outcome measures included lucidity, reflectiveness, interactive behavior, role change, constructive action, and fear and threat, as measured by the participants' self-ratings. The results support the use of this protocol in further studies of lucid dream induction and nightmare/trauma resolution."

This fascinating state of mind is relatively rare but there is a variety of validated induction methods to increase lucid dream frequency. For the dreamer lucid dreams are fun (e.g., flying) and helpful (coping with nightmares or training motor skills). For the researcher, lucid dreaming is fascinating because skilled lucid dreamers can produce signals by moving their eyes in a specific pattern and the recording machine can measure these movements. For example, the dreamer can signal becoming lucid, then count to ten (or taking ten steps), and signal again. The researcher can check the recoding to know how long counting to ten took in the dream. In an fMRI-EEG study, a lucid dreamer did hand clenching in the dream and activity in the motor cortex was found; a sophisticated way to demonstrate the body-mind relationship during sleep."

This unique state is an emerging area of scientific research and a promising method for the study of dreaming. Lucid dreams can be objectively verified on a polysomnogram through volitional eye movements. Lucid dreams occur during REM sleep and are associated with increased brain activation. It is unknown whether the state is associated with activation of specific brain regions or rhythms. Lucid dreaming offers a method to research dreamed behaviors and content. Preliminary data suggest it may also be useful in clinical applications, particularly for nightmares."
15,10.31234/osf.io/bn8dr,Lucid Dreaming: a State of Consciousness with Features of Both Waking and Non-Lucid Dreaming,"Lucid dreaming (LD) is a fun and interesting activity, but most participants have difficulties in attaining lucidity, retaining it during the dream, concentrating on the needed task and remembering the results. This motivates to search for a new way to enhance lucid dreaming via different induction techniques, including chemicals and electric brain stimulation. However, results are still unstable. An alternative approach is to reach the lucid dreaming-like states via altered state of consciousness not related to dreaming. Several methods such as guided visualization, internal dialog, creative writing, hypnosis, hypnagogia, daydreaming, DMT trips, voice dialog, shamanic journey, rebirthing, and “forcing” tulpas can help in attaining such states. One of the most promising of them is Jungian “active imagination” (AIM) technique, which allows unconscious content to build up inside some mental frames. This article explores the hypothesis of replacing lucid dreaming research with active imagination, and the conditions and ways to accomplish it. Method: An open label pilot experiment was performed in 2004-2005 in Moscow, Russia with 100 participants. Results: The results show that there are two groups of people: ones with “visual imagination screen” and others have “mental imagination screen”. AIM works perfectly as a replacement for lucid dreams only for the first group of people. For the second group, it created interesting content, but not visual or emotional intensity equal to enter lucid dreaming like state. No known instruments helped to move the person from one group to another. The first group consisted of young females, while the second mostly contained males with rational and mathematical type of personality. Conclusion: AIM partly works as a replacement for LD, as it works great only for half of people, and it requires a sitter. However, AIM outperforms LD in reliability and availability in any circumstance: it could be performed even by text chat or in a crowd. It is also better than LD in retaining concentration on topic and the easiness of memorizing the results (which could be recorded). Self-performed AIM is less effective. AIM can be improved by intelligent chat bots as sitters and weak brain stimulation that can increase the probability of attaining something like hypnogogic state."

17,10.31219/osf.io/rh4qs,Lucid dreaming: an age-dependent brain dissociation,"Lucid dreams often coincide with having control over dream events in real-time, although the limitations of dream control are not completely understood. The current study probed the ability of lucid dreamers to reinstate waking scene memories while dreaming. After brief exposure to an experimental scene, participants were asked to reinstate the scene while lucid dreaming (i.e., change dream scenery to match real-world scene). Qualitative analysis revealed that successful dream scene reinstatements were overwhelmingly inaccurate with respect to the original experimental scene. Importantly, reinstatement inaccuracies held even when the dreamer was aware of them during the dream, suggesting a dissociation between memory access while dreaming and dream imagery. The ability to change the environment of a dream speaks to the high amount of lucid dream control, yet the inaccuracies speak to a lack of detailed control. Reinstating context during lucid sleep offers an experimental method to investigate sleep, dreams, and memory."

Lucid dreamers report being able to freely remember the circumstances of waking life, to think clearly, and to act deliberately upon reflection, all the while experiencing a dream world that seems vividly real (Green, 1968; LaBerge, 1985a). This is all in contrast to the usual characterization of dreams as typically lacking any reflective awareness or true volition (Rechtschaffen, 1978)."

The first time I did this was in a dream in which I seemed to be falling. My instinct was to wake myself before I reached the ground, but, instead, I allowed the fall to go on; by now I was fairly sure that there was no real danger because it was only a dream. As I remember, the fall ended in no sudden bump, but, instead, the dream changed and turned out not to be unpleasant at all."

        A theoretical and empirical association between lucid dreaming and mindfulness, as well as lucid dreaming and nightmares has previously been observed; however, the relationship between nightmares and mindfulness has received surprisingly little attention. Here, we present the findings of two studies exploring the relation of nightmare frequency and distress with two components of mindfulness, termed presence and acceptance, as well as lucid dreaming. Study 1 (N=338) consisted of a low percentage of frequent lucid dreamers whereas Study 2 (N=187) consisted primarily of frequent lucid dreamers that used lucid dream induction training techniques and meditation. Mindful acceptance showed a more robust association with nightmare-related variables in comparison to mindful presence. Meditation expertise inversely related to nightmare frequency and the practice of lucid dreaming induction techniques inversely related to nightmare frequency and distress. Finally, in Study 2 a positive correlation between lucid dreaming frequency and mindfulness was apparent. The present findings support the notion that wakeful mindfulness is associated with the quality of dreams and extend previous research by suggesting a disentangled role of the two facets of mindfulness in dream variation. This association remains open for experimental manipulation, the result of which could have clinical implications."

Beyond merely describing lucid dreaming, the “first scientist” also sought to explain how such a thing could happen. He argued that if someone were to place his finger directly in front of your eyes without your observing his doing it, the resulting double image would cause you to believe that you were seeing two fingers. If on the other hand, you were to observe his finger as it nears your eye, you would not be misled by your double vision into believing that there actually were two fingers. “Exactly so it is in the states of sleep,” Aristotle continued, “if the sleeper perceives that he is asleep, and is conscious of the sleeping state during which the perception comes before his mind, it presents itself still, but something within him speaks to this effect: ‘The image of Koriskos presents itself, but the real Koriskos is not present’ ” (Aristotle, 1952, pp. 702–706)."

27,10.31234/osf.io/5x6hj,Cardiovascular responses to dreamed physical exercise during REM lucid dreaming.,"The commonsense view is that a lucid dream starts when the dreamer realizes that they are currently dreaming. The notion of realization, however, has been accepted at face value, with little consideration of whether the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming in the sense of actual reasoning, or if it is a mere epiphenomenon of lucid dream initiation. This article offers a solution to this problem by, first, arguing that the transition to lucidity can occur as a result of successful reasoning, and second, building a model of this reasoning in terms of probabilistic reasoning. The established Bayesian model explains realization in lucid dreams taking under consideration two factors: the beliefs that the dreamer holds on what is generally probable and improbable, and the dreamer’s admissibility of being in a dream. Defended against important objections, the model offers an explanation of lucid dream initiation, relevant for future research on dreaming."

Based on analyses of the incidence of this dream experience among university students and among persons with an expressed interest in dreaming, a majority have reported experiencing at least one lucid dream during their lifetime, and about 20% have reported experiencing lucid dreams with relative frequency. Our goal in this chapter is to describe and to integrate what has been learned through research about individuals who experience lucid dreams. To this end we will present data derived from the study of four separable but not unrelated functional domains for which subject differences associated with lucid dreaming, or lucidity, have been found. These functional domains are (1) oculomotor/equilibratory; (2) visual/imaginal; (3) intellectual/creative, and (4) personal/interpersonal. The extent of individual differences in lucid dreaming and the methods by which these differences have been investigated will also be discussed. Because methodology is an integral part of research into individual differences, methodological considerations will first be presented."

Rather, by techniques described by Dr. Hobson and others, lucidity can be induced in association with dreams that would otherwise be single-minded. In turn, this means that lucidity must originate from specific brain processes. Early imaging studies showed low levels of frontal lobe neural activity during REM sleep, suggesting that the mechanism for lucidity might be at least partly localized to that area. This hypothesis is bolstered by reports of dream-like mentation during wakefulness in patients with frontal lobe injury."
30,10.31234/osf.io/6ub4d,Lucid Dreaming,"The application of lucid-dreaming therapy as a treatment for sleep disorders is hampered by a lack of information about the variable consequences of attempting these sorts of dreams. The current study sought to quantify positive and negative aspects of seeking lucid dreams, describe their phenomenology in detail, and identify features associated with positive or negative experiences. Observational data from a massive lucid-dream discussion forum was analyzed to capture lucid-dreaming themes. Forum posts were independently rated on multiple dimensions hypothesized to contribute to the valence of lucidity-related phenomena. Our results revealed that lucid dreams can end recurring nightmares, but they can also induce harrowing dysphoric dreams. The realization of dreaming was less likely to be associated with negative experiences, and dreams with high control were associated with positive experiences. We translated our results into a process model that describes the progression from lucid-dream induction to waking benefit, identifying potential areas of concern. Our results and model suggest that successfully inducing high-control lucid dreams poses low risk for negative outcomes, and that negative outcomes primarily result from failed induction attempts or lucid dreams with low dream control. Whereas lucid dreaming has valuable therapeutic and recreational potential, our findings provide critical insight into its negative associations, with recommendations for how to avoid them in future applications."

It is possible thanks to the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reinforced by other cortical areas of the brain. As previous studies show, it is much more common among children and adolescents than among adults, as prevalence of LD relate to a degree of maturity of the CNS.AimThe study was designed to assess incidence of lucid dreaming among youth and compare it with the prevalence in general population.Materials and MethodsA questionnaire about sleep hygiene, distinguishing also between past and present experiences of lucid dreaming, has been developed. It was distributed both in paper version and on-line. IP control has been introduced for the virtual participants. Timeline for material gathering covered 01/01-15/03/2014.ResultsStudy confirmed that age has a significant role on lucid dreams appearance. Participants of the study with bad sleep hygiene (irregular time of sleeping, watching TV before going to sleep, hard to digest dinners) less frequently experienced lucid dreams. Women seems to be more interested in LD’s developing techniques, however there is a small knowledge about positive aspects of lucid dreaming among Poles.ConclusionsLack of knowledge about the phenomenon of lucid dreaming among the population may affect the results of future studies in this field."

Integral models seek holistic understanding by combining third-person, empirical perspectives with first-person, subjective experience. Here, the proposed model provides a comparative analysis of immersive virtual reality (VR) platforms and the practice of lucid dreaming (maintaining conscious self-awareness while dreaming). Based on a discursive analysis of technologists’ statements about VR, and a review of literature on lucid dreaming, this article identifies a largely unexamined area of research. Indeed, the proposed model suggests that dream research is highly relevant to VR development as a catalyst for ethical critique of emerging commercial technologies. Though informed by Buddhist philosophy, this is primarily a secular approach based in moral-developmental psychology and contemplative studies. It constitutes an example of Contemplative Media Studies, which involves the application of contemplative practices and principles to the critical analysis of media technologies, content, and institutions."

Such  a  task  grows  even  more  complex  as  one  turns  to  recollection  of  so  called  lucid  dreams.  The  article  covers  different types of messages published on the Dream Hackers forum. That  online community is the largest Russian-language platform for publishing  such  texts.  The  dream-hackers  believe  that  it  is  possible  to  control  the  dreams,  create  maps  of  the  dreamed  places  and  objects  common  for  different dreamers and jointly experience dream plots. Among the stories  of  the  forum  participants  one  may  find  the  stories  about  the  so-called  “talismans”, or, the specific objects that can be transferred from the dream  to  the  material  world,  as  well  as  the  mentions  of  the  different  marks  left  on the body of a dreamer after waking up, such as scratches, wounds etc.  Such beliefs blur the line between the dreaming and the wakefulness and  question the credibility of the reality itself. Furthermore, the article analyzes the basic functions of the mapping  of “lucid  dreams”  mapping.  The  most  important  of  the  functions  is  to  increase  the  “awareness”,  in  other  words,  to  achieve  the  key  state  of  consciousness for the dream hackers."

49,10.1016/j.paid.2004.02.003,Relationships between video game play factors and frequency of lucid and control dreaming experiences.,"AbstractThe term lucid dream designates a dream in which the dreamer is––while dreaming––aware that she/he is dreaming. Within an unselected student sample, 82% of the participants reported the occurrence of at least one lucid dream. In this sample, lucid dreaming frequency was not associated with the Big Five personality factors and, thus, theories linking lucid dreaming with introversion or well-being, that is, low neuroticism scores have not been supported. However, substantial but small correlations have been found for two openness facts (“fantasy”, “ideas”) and for dimensions which are associated with the openness to experience factor: Thin boundaries, Absorption and Imagination. Since these correlations are similar to corresponding correlations to dream recall frequency and the relationships between lucid dreaming frequency and these personality dimensions are mediated by dream recall frequency, it might be concluded that the direct relationship between lucid dreaming frequency and personality is rather small. Other variables such as meditation experience, field independence on a perceptual level, performance of the vestibular system should be included in future models explaining interindividual differences in lucid dreaming frequency. Nightmare frequency was moderately associated with lucid dreaming frequency. Although partialling out dream recall frequency reduced the magnitude of the correlation, the still significant partial correlation supports the reports of lucid dreamers that nightmares can trigger lucidity. Controlled studies investigating the effect of training the technique of lucid dreaming on nightmare frequency have not yet been carried out."

51,10.1016/j.mehy.2013.04.049,Lucid dreaming: Paradoxes of dreaming consciousness.,"AbstractSeveral lines of evidence converge to the idea that rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is a good model to foster our understanding of psychosis. Both REMS and psychosis course with internally generated perceptions and lack of rational judgment, which is attributed to a hyperlimbic activity along with hypofrontality. Interestingly, some individuals can become aware of dreaming during REMS, a particular experience known as lucid dreaming (LD), whose neurobiological basis is still controversial. Since the frontal lobe plays a role in self-consciousness, working memory and attention, here we hypothesize that LD is associated with increased frontal activity during REMS. A possible way to test this hypothesis is to check whether transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation of the frontal region during REMS triggers LD. We further suggest that psychosis and LD are opposite phenomena: LD as a physiological awakening while dreaming due to frontal activity, and psychosis as a pathological intrusion of dream features during wake state due to hypofrontality. We further suggest that LD research may have three main clinical implications. First, LD could be important to the study of consciousness, including its pathologies and other altered states. Second, LD could be used as a therapy for recurrent nightmares, a common symptom of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Finally, LD may allow for motor imagery during dreaming with possible improvement of physical rehabilitation. In all, we believe that LD research may clarify multiple aspects of brain functioning in its physiological, altered and pathological states."

Thus, the aim was to investigate the effect of keeping a dream diary on lucid dream frequency and the correlates of the frequency of lucid dreams in the diary with the Big Five personality factors. The study included 1,612 dreams reported by 425 persons. The present findings showed that lucid dreams are quite rare (1.36%) in an unselected student sample. The frequency of lucid dream in the 2-week diary period was lower than the retrospectively estimated lucid dream frequency. Whereas the negative association between lucid dream frequency and agreeableness was reported previously, the negative correlation between lucid dream frequency and neuroticism is a new finding. Furthermore, the exploratory analysis showed that a considerable number of lucid dreams did not include some form of dream control. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to study the relationship between personality, especially neuroticism and agreeableness, and lucid dreaming in a more detailed way. "

                  Introduction
                  Nightmares can cause poorer sleep quality. Various mechanisms have been explored as potential treatments for nightmares, including mindfulness practices and lucid dreaming. Presently, little literature has looked at the interaction effects between mindfulness and lucid dreaming to reduce nightmare distress.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A sample of 275 individuals was recruited from both the United States and Thailand via social media and a student pool of research subjects at UNC Charlotte. Data were recorded on participants’ demographic information, lucid dreaming from the Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams Scale (Voss et al., 2013), Mindfulness using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionaire (Baer et al., 2006), Nighmares via the Nightmare Distress Questionaire (Belicki, 1992), and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989). Higher scores on each measure were associated with more lucid dreaming, more mindful behaviors, more severe nightmares, and poorer sleep quality. PROCESS model 8 was run to conduct a moderated mediation analysis (Hayes, 2018). Lucid dreaming was used as the predictor; sleep quality as the outcome variable, nightmare distress as the mediator and mindfulness acted as a moderator on both the direct and indirect pathway of lucid dreaming onto the mediator and outcome.
               
               
                  Results
                  Mindfulness was a significant predictor at both the mediator and outcome variables. Nightmare distress was a significant predictor of sleep quality. A statistical trend (p=.054) suggests lucid dreaming may have a positive effect on nightmare distress. In the indirect path, lucid dreaming had a positive effect on PSQI scores only for individuals with low mindfulness.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  The moderated mediation suggests that individuals with low mindfulness may see a decrease in sleep quality from lucid dreaming. This could be due to lucid dreaming being associated with more severe nightmares. A zero-effect size could not be ruled out of the confidence intervals for individuals of average or high mindfulness, but the data suggest that lucid dreaming alone may not help treat nightmares, but the combination of lucid dreaming and mindfulness therapies could promote lower distress and better sleep quality.

Becoming lucid (realizing that one is dreaming) during a nightmare allows one to alter the nightmare storyline during the nightmare itself. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; After having filled out a sleep and a posttraumatic stress disorder questionnaire, 23 nightmare sufferers were randomly divided into 3 groups; 8 participants received one 2-hour individual LDT session, 8 participants received one 2-hour group LDT session, and 7 participants were placed on the waiting list. LDT consisted of exposure, mastery, and lucidity exercises. Participants filled out the same questionnaires 12 weeks after the intervention (follow-up). &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; At follow-up the nightmare frequency of both treatment groups had decreased. There were no significant changes in sleep quality and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity.

The notion of realization, however, has been accepted at face value, with little consideration of whether the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming in the sense of actual reasoning, or if it is a mere epiphenomenon of lucid dream initiation. This article offers a solution to this problem by, first, arguing that the transition to lucidity can occur as a result of successful reasoning, and second, building a model of this reasoning in terms of probabilistic reasoning. The established Bayesian model explains realization in lucid dreams taking under consideration two factors: the beliefs that the dreamer holds on what is generally probable and improbable, and the dreamer’s admissibility of being in a dream. Defended against important objections, the model offers an explanation of lucid dream initiation, relevant for future research on dreaming."

The present study investigated the question as to whether sensory processing sensitivity is related to lucid dreaming. Overall, 1,807 persons (1,008 woman, 799 men) with a mean age of 47.75 ± 14.41 years completed the German High Sensitive Person Scale, a Big Five personality inventory, and the lucid dream frequency scale. As expected, Aesthetic Sensitivity and Low Sensory Threshold (two of the three sensory processing factors) were positively related to lucid dream frequency. Moreover, extraversion and low agreeableness were also related to lucid dreaming frequency. Although the effect sizes of these relationships are relatively small, this research can shed light on the mechanism underlying the inter-individual differences in lucid dream frequency. "

               In lucid dreams the dreamer is aware that he or she is dreaming. Although such dreams are not that uncommon, many aspects of lucid dream phenomenology are still unclear. An online survey was conducted to gather data about lucid dream origination, duration, active or passive participation in the dream, planned actions for lucid dreams, and other phenomenological aspects. Among the 684 respondents who filled out the questionnaire, there were 571 lucid dreamers (83.5%). According to their reports, lucid dreams most often originate spontaneously in adolescence. The average lucid dream duration is about 14 minutes. Lucid dreamers are likely to be active in their lucid dreams and plan to accomplish different actions (e.g., flying, talking with dream characters, or having sex), yet they are not always able to remember or successfully execute their intentions (most often because of awakening or hindrances in the dream environment). The frequency of lucid dream experience was the strongest predictor of lucid dream phenomenology, but some differences were also observed in relation to age, gender, or whether the person is a natural or self-trained lucid dreamer. The findings are discussed in light of lucid dream research, and suggestions for future studies are provided."

These were done to investigate of which cognitive accomplishments dream characters are capable in lucid dreams. Nine male experienced lucid dreamers participated as subjects. They were directed to set different tasks to dream characters they met while lucid dreaming. Dream characters were asked to draw or write, to name unknown words, to find rhyme words, to make verses, and to solve arithmetic problems. Part of the dream characters actually agreed to perform the tasks and were successful, although the arithmetic accomplishments were poor. From the phenomenological findings, nothing contradicts the assumption that dream characters have consciousness in a specific sense. Herefrom the conclusion was drawn, that in lucid dream therapy communication with dream characters should be handled as if they were rational beings. Finally, several possibilities of assessing the question, whether dream characters possess consciousness, can be examined with the aid of psychophysiological experiments. "
78,10.1007/978-3-319-07296-8_35,Lucid Dreaming,"That Hobson’s grand reformulation of the meaning of dreaming to consciousness has been greeted with hostility as well as approbation is testimony to its vigor. “To sleep, perchance to dream – aye there’s the rub,” quoth Hamlet, and rubbing generates friction. The idea that dreaming is a kind of warming up of consciousness for the demands of the day is consistent with the fact that REM sleep usually does not start until 90&nbsp;min after falling asleep, and REM periods increase in length from 10&nbsp;min at the beginning of the sleep cycle to an hour toward morning. Loss of REM sleep adversely affects daytime consciousness more than does loss of nonREM sleep. Depriving animals of REM sleep for several weeks leads to their death. Salient to Hobson’s theory is the fact that the percentage of sleep devoted to REM activity is highest in infancy and childhood, even controlling for the fact that infants and children sleep longer than do adults. So as consciousness is growing and developing, REM activity is stirring it up. So perhaps dreaming is something akin to running the engine to start a balky car when the engine is cold – revving it up to catch and run normally."

This can then result in the conscious control of events or content of the dream.

The current study probed the ability of lucid dreamers to reinstate waking scene memories while dreaming. After brief exposure to an experimental scene, participants were asked to reinstate the scene while lucid dreaming (i.e., change dream scenery to match real-world scene). Qualitative analysis revealed that successful dream scene reinstatements were overwhelmingly inaccurate with respect to the original experimental scene. Importantly, reinstatement inaccuracies held even when the dreamer was aware of them during the dream, suggesting a dissociation between memory access while dreaming and dream imagery. The ability to change the environment of a dream speaks to the high amount of lucid dream control, yet the inaccuracies speak to a lack of detailed control. Reinstating context during lucid sleep offers an experimental method to investigate sleep, dreams, and memory."

Cross-sectional studies found a negative relationship between sleep quality and lucid dreaming frequency, but this relationship was explained by nightmare frequency. The present study included 149 participants keeping a dream diary for five weeks though the course of a lucid dream induction study. The results clearly indicate that there is no negative effect of having a lucid dream on the feeling of being refreshed in the morning compared to nights with the recall of a non-lucid dream; on the contrary, the feeling of being refreshed was higher after a night with a lucid dream. Future studies should be carried out to elicit tiredness and sleepiness during the day using objective and subjective measurement methods."

The present study explores the relationship among mindfulness experience, meditation practice history, and lucid dreaming. Undergraduate students and meditators completed questionnaires assessing trait mindfulness, lucid dreaming frequency, and meditation practices. Surprisingly, lucid dreaming was not associated with meditation practice frequency or narrow-spectrum mindfulness experiences like present-centered awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance. Lucid dreaming frequency was predicted only by dream recall and mindfulness-related experiences of Transcendence. Possible personality implications are discussed. "

Additionally, the personality correlates of the age of the first lucid dream were investigated. In our sample, a small but substantial portion of individual differences concerning lucid dreaming frequency was explained by the Big Five personality factors. Openness to experiences correlated positively with lucid dreaming frequency, whereas the correlation was negative for agreeableness. The relationship between neuroticism and lucid dreaming frequency disappeared when nightmare frequency was controlled. Future researchers should examine the relationship of the Big Five factors with the attitudes toward and the contents of lucid dreams. Moreover, longitudinal studies should investigate the lucid dream socialization of children and the effect of age on the course of interest in lucid dreaming. "

                  (1) To critically test whether a previously reported increase in frontolateral 40 Hz power in lucid REM sleep, used to justify the claim that lucid dreaming is a “hybrid state” mixing sleep and wakefulness, is attributable to the saccadic spike potential (SP) artifact as a corollary of heightened REM density. (2) To replicate the finding that lucid dreams are associated with physiological activation, including heightened eye movement density, during REM sleep. (3) To conduct an exploratory analysis of changes in EEG features during lucid REM sleep
               
               
                  Methods
                  We analyzed 14 signal-verified lucid dreams (SVLDs) and baseline REM sleep segments from the same REM periods from six participants derived from the Stanford SVLD database. Participants marked lucidity onset with standard left-right-left-right-center (LR2c) eye-movement signals in polysomnography recordings.
               
               
                  Results
                  Compared to baseline REM sleep, lucid REM sleep had higher REM density (β = 0.85, p = 0.002). Bayesian analysis supported the null hypothesis of no differences in frontolateral 40 Hz power after removal of the SP artifact (BH = 0.18) and ICA correction (BH = 0.01). Compared to the entire REM sleep period, lucid REM sleep showed small reductions in low-frequency and beta band spectral power as well as increased signal complexity (all p &amp;lt; 0.05), which were within the normal variance of baseline REM sleep.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Lucid dreams are associated with higher-than-average levels of physiological activation during REM sleep, including measures of both subcortical and cortical activation. Increases in 40 Hz power in periorbital channels reflect saccadic and microsaccadic SPs as a result of higher REM density accompanying heightened activation.

106,10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110169,Lucid Dreaming in Narcolepsy,"AbstractDuring REM sleep we normally experience dreams. However, there are other less common REM sleep phenomena, like lucid dreaming (LD), false awakening (FA), sleep paralysis (SP), and out of body experiences (OBE). LD occurs when one is conscious during dreaming, and FA occurs when one is dreaming but believes that has woken up. SP is characterized by skeletal muscle atonia and occurs mainly during awakening or falling asleep. OBE is the subjective sensation of ‘leaving the physical body’. Since all these phenomena happen during REM sleep, their frequency is probably connected. The goal of this research is to explore how these phenomena are connected to each other in terms of frequency. We surveyed 974 people on the streets of Moscow and found significant correlations between the phenomena. Of those surveyed, 88% have experienced at least one of the phenomena of interest (i.e., LD, OBE, FA, and SP), which appeared to be closely correlated to each other. Furthermore, 43% of respondents stated that they often experience at least one of these phenomena. We found that the recurrence of these phenomena correlated with sleep duration and dream recall frequency. The results of the survey provide better understanding of the nature of REM sleep dissociative phenomena.Cross-correlations between REM sleep dissociated phenomena, like lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, out-of-body experiences, and false awakening, revealed by a survey."

By applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we aimed to manipulate the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during REM sleep to increase dream lucidity. Nineteen participants spent three consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. On the second and third nights they randomly received either 1&nbsp;mA tDCS for 10&nbsp;min or sham stimulation during each REM period starting with the second one. According to the participants’ self-ratings, tDCS over the DLPFC during REM sleep increased lucidity in dreams. The effects, however, were not strong and found only in frequent lucid dreamers. While this indicates some preliminary support for the involvement of the DLPFC in lucid dreaming, further research, controlling for indirect effects of stimulation and including other brain regions, is needed."

In a second study, 41 subjects were selected from the above on the basis of relative specialization in each dream form, with a control group equally high on dream recall. Here, the lucid and archetypal dreamers tended to separate themselves from nightmare sufferers on the basis of high imaginativeness, proclivity to waking mystical experience, spatial/analytic skills, and physical balance. It appears that the intensification of dreaming is expressed positively or negatively, depending on variations in these cognitive dimensions. "

                  Introduction
                  Lucid dreaming (being aware that one is dreaming) is typically a positive experience that may enhance positive mood even after waking. There is concern, however, that lucid dreaming may interfere with sleep quality. In the current experiment, participants practiced common lucid dream induction techniques over the course of a week, and kept a daily sleep and dream diary. The study objective was to assess relationships between dream lucidity and subjective sleep quality, dream emotional content, and subsequent waking mood.
               
               
                  Methods
                  There were 32 participants aged 19–33 in this open label, single arm study (mean=22.63±3.48; 6 males, 24 females). All participants completed a sleep and dream diary for 7 days that included scaled items (1–7 scale) concerning subjective sleep quality, negative and positive emotional intensity of a dream (if recalled). Participants also completed a 19-item lucidity questionnaire, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Average scores for the week were computed for all measures and Pearson’s correlations conducted between lucidity and all other measures. Participants with no dream recall (n=5) were excluded. Within-subjects analyses were undertaken by selecting each participant’s highest and lowest lucidity night (n=22; 5 participants with only minimum lucidity excluded).
               
               
                  Results
                  Positive correlations were found between lucidity and dream positive emotion (r=.490, n=27, p=.009) and positive waking mood (r=.638, n=27, p&amp;lt;.001); there were no other significant correlations (all p&amp;gt;.1). Higher lucidity was associated with more positive dream content (t(21)= -3.214, p=.004) and positive waking mood (t(25)=-4.568, p&amp;lt;.001); no other significant differences were observed.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  These data indicate that lucidity is associated with positive dreams and waking mood, with no detriment to self-reported sleep quality. The findings provide preliminary support of lucid dreaming as an intervention to improve wellbeing and mood in the short term.

114,10.1177/0276236615572594,"Dream recall, nightmares and lucid dreaming in narcoleptic patients"," The present study explored the relationship between lucidity in dreams (awareness of dreams while dreaming) and mindfulness during wakefulness, also considering meditation as a possible moderating variable. An online survey was completed by 528 respondents, of whom 386 (73.1%) had lucid dream experiences. The reported frequency of lucid dreams was found to be positively related to higher dispositional mindfulness in wakefulness. This relationship was only present in those participants who reported acquaintance with meditation. Regarding the dimensions of mindfulness, lucid dream frequency was more strongly associated with mindful presence rather than acceptance. The findings support the notion of an existing relationship between lucidity in dreams and mindfulness during wakefulness, yet it remains unclear whether the relationship is influenced by actual meditation practice or whether it reflects some natural predispositions. Future studies should examine the role of different meditation practices, investigate personality variables that might influence the relationship, and explore how different facets of mindfulness and lucidity interrelate.

In this correlational study, the sample comprised of 220 young Pakistani adults from both genders (124 women and 96 men) age range from 18 to 26 years (M = 21.14, SD = 1.87). The participants were assessed on nightmares, psychosis proneness, and lucid dreaming through the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire, Inventory of Personality Organization, and The Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams Scale respectively. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated significant inter-correlation between dream lucidity, nightmare, and psychosis proneness. Path analysis illustrated dream lucidity as a significant mediator in the link between nightmare and psychosis proneness. The results concluded that dream lucidity plays the role of facilitating factor in the development of psychosis proneness. The findings also provide insight into the role of nightmares and lucid dreaming while examining psychosis proneness."

We propose a new training strategy which achieves state-of-the-art results across three evaluation datasets while using 20\,\times 20×20\,\times –1000\,\times 1000×1000\,\times  less annotated data than competing methods. Our approach is suitable for both single and multiple object segmentation. Instead of using large training sets hoping to generalize across domains, we generate in-domain training data using the provided annotation on the first frame of each video to synthesize—“lucid dream” (in a lucid dream the sleeper is aware that he or she is dreaming and is sometimes able to control the course of the dream)—plausible future video frames. In-domain per-video training data allows us to train high quality appearance- and motion-based models, as well as tune the post-processing stage. This approach allows to reach competitive results even when training from only a single annotated frame, without ImageNet pre-training. Our results indicate that using a larger training set is not automatically better, and that for the video object segmentation task a smaller training set that is closer to the target domain is more effective. This changes the mindset regarding how many training samples and general “objectness” knowledge are required for the video object segmentation task."

123,10.2466/pms.1981.52.3.727,Lucid Dreaming Treatment for Nightmares: A Pilot Study," The occurrence of lucid dreaming (dreaming while being conscious that one is dreaming) has been verified for 5 selected subjects who signaled that they knew they were dreaming while continuing to dream during unequivocal REM sleep. The signals consisted of particular dream actions having observable concomitants and were performed in accordance with pre-sleep agreement. The ability of proficient lucid dreamers to signal in this manner makes possible a new approach to dream research—such subjects, while lucid, could carry out diverse dream experiments marking the exact time of particular dream events, allowing derivation of precise psychophysiological correlations and methodical testing of hypotheses.

In this article, I look at the recent interest in alternative therapies by the U.S. military, which has explored the possibilities of lucid dreaming in order to help soldiers cope with the adverse mental and emotional effects of combat—commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this context of concerns about effective rehabilitation and the cost of veteran care, I examine the popular science fiction films Avatar and Inception, which have been discussed in the media as illustrations of the potential use of lucid dreaming and digitally created virtual worlds to “heal” the minds of soldiers affected by modern warfare. In these media portrayals, psychology and science fiction come together to envision and promote human-machine fantasies of the endlessly salvageable and, therefore ultimately, invincible American soldier.

The term has historically been confined to the decorative arts and critically overlooked as a somewhat moribund style. As a consequence, the continuities between chinoiserie and its role in Modernist ways of looking or seeing have been paid little attention.

In addition, alternating periods of wakefulness and sleep might increase the likelihood of experiencing a lucid dream. Here we investigate the association between sleep fragmentation and lucid dreaming, with a multi-centre study encompassing four different investigations into subjective and objective measures of sleep fragmentation, nocturnal awakenings, sleep quality and polyphasic sleep schedules. Results across these four studies provide a more nuanced picture into the purported connection between sleep fragmentation and lucid dreaming: While self-assessed numbers of awakenings, polyphasic sleep and physiologically validated wake-REM sleep transitions were associated with lucid dreaming, neither self-assessed sleep quality, nor physiologically validated numbers of awakenings were. We discuss these results, and their underlying neural mechanisms, within the general question of whether sleep fragmentation and lucid dreaming share a causal link."

They are influenced by prior waking and can influence subsequent waking. Today, most dream researchers agree that dreams are constructed by the same mental processes that we use when awake, but the source of material differs (Bulkeley, 1997). They also seem to concur that dreaming plays a role in processing both external and internal information from waking, which helps adaptation to the environment by organizing perceptions, keeping cognitive mechanisms exercised, and integrating new with existing memories. Dream researcher Bill Domhoff (personal communication, July, 2001) sees the contents of dreams as being mostly continuous with our waking lives, generally expressing our conceptions and concerns. Further, studies of series of dreams show there is a lot of repetition in what an individual dreams about (Domhoff, 1996). Dreams contain the “conceptions, concerns, and interests” of the dreamer (Domhoff, 1996, p. 153), but do not necessarily reflect how they behave during their waking lives. Domhoff (1996) does not believe that dreams are compensatory, that is bringing some kind of balance or healing to our waking lives, but other dream researchers think they can sometimes be compensatory. However, this issue is difficult to scientifically assess (Van de Castle, 1994)."

A possible way to solve this issue is the combination of already known and effective induction techniques (Stumbrys, Erlacher, Schädlich, &amp; Schredl, 2012). The present study combines the wake-up-back-to-bed sleep protocol (WBTB) with reality testing and acoustic stimulation by music. The following question was posed: would repeating the same music presented during the waking dream work session during the subsequent REM sleep increase the chance of a lucid dream experience. In total 21 participants spent a single night in the sleep lab. The whole procedure induced in 3 participants a lucid dream (14.3%), however none of those lucid dreams were verified by LRLR eye signal. The success rate of a combination of auditory stimulation with reality testing thus lies below the success rate of other induction techniques. The incorporation of music as a theme was found in 9 (19.6%) out of 69 dream reports which is in accordance with previously reported incorporation rates. Beside the music presentation, other methodological adjustments were made (e.g., shortening of the first part of the night to 4.5 h), which will be discussed and hopefully help further research to increase lucid dream induction rate."

This state of consciousness opens a new experimental venue for dream research. However, laboratory study in this field is limited due to the rarity of lucid dreamers. In a previous study, we were able to induce in 50% of the participants a lucid dream in a single sleep laboratory night by combining a wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) sleep routine and a mnemonic method (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, MILD). In three experiments, we tried to replicate our earlier findings while we adapted our procedure in shortening (Exp1–3: 4.5 vs. 6 h of uninterrupted sleep in the first half of the night), simplifying (Exp2: time-based wakening vs. REM wakening in the second half of the night), and applying another induction technique (Exp3: reality testing vs. MILD). In the three conditions, four out of 15 (26%), zero out of 20 (0%), and three out of 15 (20%) participants reported a lucid dream. Compared to the original study, the earlier sleep interruption seems to reduce the lucid dream induction rate. Furthermore, without REM awakenings in the morning, lucid dream induction failed, whereas reality testing showed a lower success rate compared to MILD. Further systematic sleep laboratory studies are needed to develop reliable techniques for lucid dream research."
147,https://doi.org/10.11588/ijodr.2020.1.68010,A pilot investigation into brain-computer interface use during a lucid dream,"During lucid moments of a dream, the sleeper is aware of the dream as it is occurring, and as a result can often perform predetermined actions within the dream. This provides a unique opportunity for dream research, as lucid dreamers can send real-time signals from sleep to the external world. Historically, such sleep-to-wake communication from a lucid dream is executed via left-right eye movements, which places hard limitations on information transfer. Recent advances in biomedical equipment — specifically brain-computer interfaces — have resulted in headsets that use neural recordings to translate mental imagery into computer commands. In light of evidence suggesting that dreamed and imagined actions recruit similar neural resources, I considered the possibility that the same mental commands that are collected and translated from waking imagery could be similarly performed and detected from within a lucid dream. In this exploratory study with proof-of-concept intent, three participants were asked to use an Emotiv EPOC+ headset and companion software to map a mental motor command (pushing a block) with a resulting computer action (graphic of block moving forward). After waking training, participants attempted to induce a lucid dream while wearing the headset, and upon lucidity perform the same mental command. In two participants, subjectively reported lucid dream task completion was corroborated with video footage of the resulting computer graphic. These preliminary results suggest that a wake-trained brain-computer interface can be controlled from sleep and offer important directions for future dream communication and research."
