10.1037/h0094362,Just how lucid are lucid dreams?,"Examined the lucid dreams of 50 Ss as to whether they are also fully lucid for the following corollaries: people in the dreams are dream characters, dream objects are not real, (i.e., actions will not carry over concretely upon awakening), the dreamer does not need to obey waking-life physics to achieve a goal, and memory of the waking world is intact rather than amnestic or fictitious. Many lucid dreams were too brief to evaluate on all corollaries. Only about half of the lengthier accounts were lucid for any particular corollary and less than a quarter were lucid on all 4. A related and reciprocal category of dreams that are lucid in terms of some of these 4 corollaries but miss the realization that ""I'm dreaming"" were also examined. The correlations among the corollaries, between correlations and length of lucid dreams, and between awareness and degree of experience with lucidity imply that they are on a cohesive continuum.

10.1037/h0094350,Efficacy of lucid dream induction for lucid and non-lucid dreamers.,"Evaluated the efficacy of a lucid dream induction (LDI) technique with 17 male and 30 female university students (aged 19â26 yrs) who were introduced to P. Tholey's (1983) combined technique for LDI. One group of Ss had experienced lucid dreams while the other group reported never having experienced lucid dreams. Another group of nonlucid dreamers served as a nontreatment control group. Among previously nonlucid dreamers, a significantly greater proportion of Ss who presented with the LDI technique reported a lucid dream. This group also reported more lucid dreams in total than the nontreatment control group. Among prior lucid dreamers, the technique was found to increase the number, relative to baseline levels, of lucid dreams reported. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000114,"False awakenings in lucid dreamers: How they relate with lucid dreams, and how lucid dreamers relate with them.","In this article, some previously unreported findings from an old web survey about false awakenings (FAs) in 90 lucid dreamers will be discussed. FAs have been told to be frequent concomitants of lucid dreams, but objective data are lacking. In the present study, a positive correlation was found between the reported frequencies of FAs and lucid dreams, r = .51, p < .001, and 56 (62%) subjects reported experiencing habitual transitions from FAs to lucid dreams (or/and vice versa). These findings confirm previous anecdotal reports with objective data and suggest a similar neurophysiologic basis for the two kinds of experience. FAs appear to be characterized by a strong propensity of the experients to exercise a metacognitive judgment upon their state by means of reality checks (76% of respondents). Reality checkers reported that lucid dreams were a habitual termination of their FAs significantly more often than nonreality checkers (p < .001). This appears to be the first empirical datum in support of the frequently self-reported ability of lucid dreamers to turn âactivelyâ their FAs into lucid dreams. Given the similarity between FAs and sleep paralysis in terms of possible state overlap, getting practice in performing reality checks could be a useful tool to manage some cases of recurrent sleep paralysis as well.

10.1037/drm0000090,"Lucid nightmares: A survey of their frequency, features, and factors in lucid dreamers.","This article reports the first systematic study on lucid nightmaresâterrifying lucid dreams with a lack of dream control. An online survey was completed by 634 participants, of whom 574 had had previous lucid dream experience. According to the reports of lucid dreamers, less than half of them had experienced a lucid nightmare, and only 1% of them could be considered as suffering from lucid nightmaresâexperiencing them once a week or more frequently. Lucid nightmares appear to be as distressing as ordinary nightmares. Lack of dream control and intense fear are among their most common features, followed by violent autonomous dream characters and the inability to wake up. Lucid nightmares are more likely to occur for women and nightmare sufferers, yet also for more frequent lucid dreamers and for those who experience lucid dreams spontaneously rather than them being induced deliberately. Key methodological points, for example, whether the awakening criterion in the definition of lucid nightmares should be included, are addressed, and suggestions for future research are provided.

10.1037/h0094324,Frameworks for understanding lucid dreaming: A review.,"Reviews psychological and psychophysiological frameworks for understanding the experience of lucid dreaming (knowing you are dreaming while the dream is ongoing). Several of the psychological approaches take an information processing view of lucid dreaming. One approach sees lucidity in sleep as a cognitive tool whereas others put more emphasis on a model of self awareness. Psychophysiological perspectives show that lucidity is a significantly more aroused REM sleep experience than nonlucid REM sleep. The EEG and lucidity work is based on the association of lucidity to meditation. This sleep experience is also viewed from the framework of spatial skills especially as implicated in vestibular system functioning. The connectionist view of neural nets is another explanatory vehicle. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000188,Lucid nightmare as a state midway between nightmare and lucid dream.,"Lucid nightmares, which are distinguished by their qualities pertaining to both nightmares and lucid dreams, might constitute a hybrid state in between a nightmare and a lucid dream. To test the notion that some lucid dreams might be transformed from nightmares, this study examined a structural equation model in which nightmares were hypothesized to predict lucid nightmares and therefore lucid dreams, with consideration of positive and negative trait emotions. This model was tested on a sample of 249 Hong Kong Chinese adults. The latent constructs of the model were indicated by the items and subscales adopted from the Dream Intensity Scale, Dream Motif Scale, Brief Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale, and Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory. The structural equation modeling analysis supported the proposed role of lucid nightmare and negative emotionality as a predictor of nightmares.

The present study confirmed that lucid dreamers, both frequent and occasional (n = 26), were more internal on J. Rotter's (1966) locus of control measure and scored higher on J. Cacioppo and R. Petty's (1982) need for cognition measure than did nonlucid dreamers (n = 24). Frequent but not occasional lucid dreamers were more field independent on H. A. Witkin et al.'s (1971) Group Embedded Figures Test than the nonlucid dreamers. Need for cognition, internality on locus of control, and field independence all correlated with each other. The results can be argued to show a continuity between styles of waking and dreaming personality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000073,Lucid music â A pilot study exploring the experiences and potential of music-making in lucid dreams.,"In a lucid dream, the dreamer knows that he or she is dreaming and can thus deliberately carry out actions. The original goal of this study was to investigate musical practice in lucid dreams and its possible effects as well as the quality of the experiences. A total of 5 musicians were interviewed about their lucid dreams in which they had played instruments and sung. However, the interviewees were more interested in pleasure and inspiration than in actual practice and skill improvement. Therefore, the results provide more general information than planned. It could be shown that singing and playing musical instruments mostly work well in lucid dreams. Lucid music dreams were often accompanied by positive emotions and led to several positive effects in waking life, like facilitated guitar playing and enhanced confidence. Two interviewees especially enjoyed improvising solo in lucid dreams. The participants also emphasized the creative and inspirational potential of lucid music dreams, which is worth further investigation. Combining previous research on athletic practice in lucid dreams and the clues obtained from this study, it is likely that musicians could use lucid dreams to improve their skills. Future studies should further explore the potential of lucid music dreams for both creativity and performance in waking life. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/a0036908,Spontaneous lucid dreaming frequency and waking insight.,"Spontaneous lucid dreaming is characterized by the realization that the currently perceived reality is in fact a dream. As this ability differs between individuals, specific cognitive abilities have been sought that might explain this variability. Here, âinsight,â a key feature of spontaneous lucid dreaming, is investigated. Frequent, occasional, and nonlucid dreamers were compared on their successful performance of a compound remote associate problem-solving task, designed to measure insight. Results show that frequent lucid dreamers solve significantly more insight problems overall than nonlucid dreamers. This suggests that the insight experienced during the dream state may relate to the same underlying cognition needed for insight in the waking state.

It was hypothesized that the difficulty of performing cerebrally lateralized tasks during a lucid dream would vary with the dominant hemisphere for that task, with less difficulty for right hemisphere tasks. Twenty-seven participants rated the difficulty of performing three matched pairs of left hemisphere and right hemisphere tasks, first in a lucid dream, and later in their waking imagination. Results indicated right hemisphere dominance during lucid dreaming, especially among right-handed participants. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/a0019248,Lucid dreaming frequency and change blindness performance.,"There are reports of lucid dreaming being cued by the recognition that a dream event is bizarre from the point of view of waking life. However, for dreams in general, there is a lack of ability to notice or question bizarre occurrences. A waking-life analog of this inability is here proposed to be change blindness. In change blindness tasks, a prominent alteration to a photograph occurs repeatedly, but it is rare for these changes to be spotted immediately. It was hypothesized that lucid dreamers would perform better on change blindness tasks than would nonlucid dreamers. Contrary to the hypothesis, individuals who reported having lucid dreams more than once per month (n = 13), occasional lucid dreamers (n = 13), and nonlucid dreamers (n = 12) were found not to differ significantly on performance on 6 change blindness tasks. How the usually proficient unconscious detection of errors during waking life is disabled during dreams remains to be determined, but it does not seem from the results here to have a simple relationship with the waking-life phenomenon of change blindness.

10.1037/1053-0797.16.2.88,Psychophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming.,"The main goal of the present study was to explore electrophysiological differences between lucid and nonlucid dreams in REM sleep. Seven men and four women experienced in lucid dreaming underwent polysomnographic recordings in the sleep laboratory on two consecutive nights. EEG signals were subjected to spectral analysis to obtain five different frequency bands between 1 and 20 Hz. Lucidity was determined by both subjective dream reports and eye-movement signals made by the subjects in response to light stimuli indicating a REM period. The main discrimination factor between lucid and nonlucid dreaming was found in the beta-1 frequency band (13-19 Hz), which in lucid dreaming was increased in both parietal regions. The ratio of frontal to parietal beta-1 activity was 1 to 1.16 in nonlucid and 1 to 1.77 in lucid dreaming. A tendency towards the greatest increase was observed in the left parietal lobe (P3), an area of the brain considered to be related to semantic understanding and self-awareness.

10.1037/h0094432,Validity established of DreamLight cues for eliciting lucid dreaming.,"Examined the effectiveness of DreamLight (DL), a biofeedback device designed to deliver light cues during REM sleep, for inducing lucid dreams. 14 adults used DLs in their home on 4 to 24 nights. They were unaware that the DLs were specially programmed to deliver cues only on alternate nights. 11 Ss reported 32 lucid dreams, 22 from nights with light cues and 10 from nights without cues. All lucid dreams scored (by judges blind to DL condition) as being cued by the DL's stimuli, occurred on nights when the DL was actually delivering cues. Ss reported seeing in their dreams what they believed to be DL cues significantly more often on light cue nights (73 total) compared to nights without light cues (9). It is concluded that cuing with sensory stimuli by the DL appears to increase a S's probability of having lucid dreams, and that most of the resulting lucid dreams are due to the specific effect of light cues rather than general placebo factors.

Other prominent writers about lucid dreams such as J. Gackenbach (1989), and H. Hunt (1989) bring experiences of light into their discussions.

10.1037/drm0000145,Lucid dreaming: Effects of culture in a U.S. American sample.,"Lucid dreaming is defined as a dream in which an individual becomes consciously aware that s/he is dreaming while dreaming. Concepts about lucid dreaming vary strongly in different cultures. The present survey was completed by 3,992 Americans 18 years and older in age (2,310 women and 1,682 men), with a mean age of 48.26 Â± 17.09 years. Lucid dream occurrence in the total sample was 35.72%, with Hispanic participants reporting a significantly lower frequency of lucid dreams compared with White participants, a difference that might reflect a greater prominence of lucid dreaming in more individualistic cultures versus more communitarian cultures. Although the findings of this study suggest specific cultural effects on lucid dream frequency and other aspects of dreaming, more empirical research is needed to help to clarify how strongly these effects may appear in dreaming in general, and lucid dreaming in particular, among a wider range of todayâs world population.

But only a few studies have investigated cardiovascular changes during dreamed physical activities. This study tests the hypothesis that physical activity (performing squats) carried out in a lucid dream increases cardiovascular parameters in the sleeping body. Therefore, 5 proficient lucid dreamers experienced with the eye-signaling method during lucidity spent 2 to 4 nonconsecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. Instructed to carry out specific tasks (counting and performing squats) while lucid dreaming, the participants reported becoming lucid and signaling in 11 REM periods recorded. Fourteen complete lucid dream tasks were verified by eye signaling. The results showed a statistically significant increase of heart rate between the preexercise and exercise periods and the postexercise period. The results for respiration rate were less clear. Even though respiration rate during the exercise period was higher than during the pre- and postexercise period, statistical significance was only found for the second comparison. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that lucidly dreamed motor action causes increases at the level of peripheral effectors. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000012,Lucid dreaming frequency and alarm clock snooze button use.,"There have been suggestions that the deliberate alteration of sleep-related behaviors, such as briefly going back to sleep after waking, can be used to induce lucid dreams. The current study extends this work by investigating the association between lucid dream frequency and alarm clock use. Eighty-four participants (44 females, 39 males, 1 not stated, mean age = 33.80 years, SD = 15.00) completed an online retrospective questionnaire that measured lucid dreaming frequency, frequency of alarm clock use, frequency of snooze button use per morning, and average number of awakenings per night. Significant positive relationships were found between lucid dreaming frequency and number of awakenings per night (Ï = .30), number of uses of alarm clock snoozing function per morning (Ï = .22), and dream recall frequency (Ï = .52). In a logistic regression, whether a participant had ever had a lucid dream was predicted only by overall dream recall frequency and frequency of snooze button use (Exp(B) odds ratios = 4.92 and 2.52, respectively). Reasons for the association might be that lucid dreamers and snooze button users share some individual difference characteristic or that the brief awakenings followed by snoozing might elicit brain activation or sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, hence resulting in a greater likelihood of lucid dreams.

10.1037/a0020881,Association of lucid dreaming frequency with Stroop task performance.,"Lucid dreaming involves the attentional skill of having metacognition about the dreamer's state of consciousness at the same time as being engaged in the dream scenario. A combination of two levels of cognition also occurs in the incongruent condition of the Stroop task, where there is interference between the attentional demands of a relatively difficult (color naming) and an easy (reading) task. It was thus hypothesized that frequent lucid dreamers would perform better on the Stroop task than would nonlucid dreamers. Individuals who reported having lucid dreams more than once per month (n = 15) were found to be significantly faster on the incongruent condition of the Stroop task than were occasional lucid dreamers (n = 15) or nonlucid dreamers (n = 15). The groups did not differ on the standard colored nonword control condition. Continuity in attentional ability between waking and dreaming cognition was thus found. This continuity may counteract the psychophysiologically dominant and possibly evolutionarily selected lack of self-awareness in dreams.

The present study provides a thorough investigation into 3 of the most promising cognitive lucid dream induction techniquesâreality testing, wake back to bed (WBTB), and the mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD) technique. A sample of 169 Australian participants completed a pretest questionnaire, provided baseline logbook data in Week 1, and practiced lucid dream induction techniques in Week 2. Results showed that the combination of reality testing, WBTB and the MILD technique was effective at inducing lucid dreams.

Findings suggest a link between lucid awareness and volition within dreams and the management of waking cognition and emotion.

10.1037/drm0000139,Examining the triggers of lucid insight.,"Approximately half the population have experienced a lucid dream. Yet, it is not well understood how an individual realizes they are dreaming (i.e., lucid insight). A few studies suggest it can be triggered by a nightmare, or by the identification of inconsistencies/dream-like qualities/peculiarities. The present study aimed to produce a detailed typology of lucidity triggers to inform consideration of the nature of associated thought processes. A total of 91 lucid dreamers were identified in an undergraduate sample of 148. Lucid dreamers were asked to describe what it was, if anything, that had made them realize they were dreaming. Thematic analysis of responses extracted evidence of four overarching triggers consistent with previous research: identification of an abnormality, identification of a dream-like quality, an emotionally arousing dream event, and miscellaneous. It was uniquely identified that âabnormalitiesâ within the dream were those inconsistent with waking knowledge rather than with the accompanying dream content. Novel triggers were identified that were classifiable as subthemes under the previously identified triggers, and triggers co-occurred in a third of cases. Novel triggers included âdÃ©jÃ  rÃªvÃ©,â the feeling that one has dreamt the experience before, as well as âself-comfort/denialâ involving an emotionally driven denial of the reality of a distressing dream. Nightmare-induced lucidity appeared to arise via qualitatively diverse paths. The nature of the triggers indicates that higher order cognition can precede, and promote, lucid insight. This sheds light on a key theoretical issue of whether lucid insight is a prerequisite for the reemergence of higher order cognition. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000153,Increasing perception vividness during lucid dreaming by spinning: A pilot study.,"In lucid dreams (LDs), people can control the events of the dream plot and experience vivid perceptions. However, perception vividness in LDs is sometimes very low, thus preventing practitioners from fully experiencing the phenomenon or using it for a predetermined goal. The goal of this research is to test whether spinning in a LD can lead to an increase in the vividness of the perceived space. We had 123 volunteers spin while in a LD and then stop to check for changes in the degree of perception. For 46% of the volunteers, vividness became higher after spinning, and 30% of them (14% of all) reported having perceptions higher than in wakefulness. The result of this research may enhance the general understanding of the nature of subjective perceptions in LDs, which, in turn, will help in researching related phenomena and their applications.

The Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams scale (LuCiD), Dream Intensity Scale (DIS), Resilience Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ), and Rotterâs Locus of Control Scale (LOC) were administered to 119 Hong Kong university students. The RAQ score was significantly indicated by the LuCiD and LOC scores, with the RAQ Problem-Solving subscale score being indicated by the DIS Dream Work subscale and LOC scores. The positive associations between the RAQ and the LuCiD and between the RAQ Problem-Solving and DIS Dream Work subscales were not mediated by the LOC. These findings suggest that internal locus of control does not account for the association between resilience and dream variables. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000172,Flying limitations in lucid dreams.,"Lucid dreams (LDs) are dreams in which people intentionally or unintentionally become conscious and take control of the dream plot, allowing them to experience different emotions and perceptions. The laws of physics do not apply to the LD world. As such, it supposedly lacks the limitations that we experience in everyday life. In the present study, we ask the following questions: Is this the case? Do we really have no limits in LDs? In this study, we investigated LD limitations on the possibility of flying. We instructed LD practitioners to fly while in an LD while performing no other movements (including jumping). That is, practitioners were to attempt to fly using only intention and thought. Then they were asked to report whether they succeeded, how much effort was required, and the duration of the flight. Most of the participants succeeded in flying while in an LD. Among those with successful results, almost everyone spoke about flying with little effort. We suggest that even within the context of LDs, some limitations prevent some practitioners from flying, which should be explored in future studies. The outcomes of our research deepen the general understanding of LDs and the capabilities of LD practitioners to realize different goals, even though LD does not follow physical laws.

The goal of this research is to test whether it is possible to create pain during lucid dreaming and maintain it upon awakening. For this study, 151 volunteers completed a task in which they needed to achieve pain during lucid dreams (LD) and then wake up. They then checked whether the pain from the dream remained after they awoke, and, if so, they reported how long the pain lasted. Of the participants, 74% experienced pain during LD and 28% of them continued feeling the pain after waking. Our results may lead to new pain treatments and a better understanding of the nature of pain, LD, and hypnopompic hallucinations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

10.1037/drm0000101,Can learning to lucid dream promote personal growth?,"A lucid dream occurs when a dreamer knows that he or she is dreaming while continuing to dream. Many people practice lucid dreaming to promote personal growth, including enhanced creativity and self-esteem. However, such benefits are evidenced by anecdotal reports and correlational studies rather than controlled experiments. Further, this existing evidence is confounded by the fact that most lucid dreaming procedures involve two supporting practicesâdream journaling and a mindfulness exercise called reality checkingâthat may be independently associated with personal growth. Our study asked whether successfully inducing lucid dreams leads to personal growth above and beyond journaling and mindfulness using an experimental design. In a sample of undergraduates (N = 32), we assessed psychological well-being and personal growth longitudinally and compared participants assigned to lucid dream training to a group that only learned journaling and mindfulness practices and a third group that did not learn any techniques. We found no significant differences between the groups on indicators of personal growth on average. However, successful lucid dreamers had higher life satisfaction and self-esteem, as well as lower stress the day after lucid dreaming, compared with unsuccessful lucid dreamers.

10.1037/drm0000102,Relationships between video game play factors and frequency of lucid and control dreaming experiences.,"Lucid and control dream states have been linked to a variety of positive psychological outcomes, but are uncommon and difficult to induce. Delineating connections between lucid and control dreaming and immersion in other virtual environments could aid in understanding the nature of those dream states and developing more effective induction training. Video game play takes place in immersive virtual environments and has been linked to more frequent lucid dreaming (Gackenbach, 2006, 2009). The current research sought to identify connections between specific genres of video game play and lucid and lucid/control dream experiences, as well as replicating established relationships between overall gameplay and engagement, incorporation of game content into dreams, and lucid and lucid/control dream experiences. Play of physically interactive games was positively correlated with lucid and lucid/control dream frequency; no other genre showed the same association. Overall game play was not associated with frequency of lucid and lucid/control dreams, but was positively correlated with incorporation of game content into dreams, which in turn was positively correlated with lucid and lucid/control dream frequency. These findings expand and clarify our understanding of the overlap between lucid and control dream states and a highly popular form of virtual environment, and may aid in the induction and therapeutic use of lucid and control dreaming.

Hypotheses were that lucid dreaming treatment would decrease nightmare frequency and state/trait anxiety, and improve the quality of sleep. Eight participants received a one-hour individual session, which consisted of lucid dreaming exercises and discussing possible constructive solutions for the nightmare. Nightmare frequency and sleep quality were measured by a sleep questionnaire, anxiety was measured by the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. At the follow-up two months later the nightmare frequency had decreased, while the sleep quality had increased slighty. There were no changes on state and trait anxiety.

The higher awareness and cognitive traits which accompany lucid dreams offer individuals a unique opportunity to use this practice to rehearse waking skills. This scoping review aimed to summarize existing evidence on the effectiveness of lucid dreaming practice (LDP) on the performance of waking skills and used a meta-analytical approach to estimate an overall effect of LDP. A total of seven studies were reviewed. Findings indicate that LDP can improve waking performance of motor tasks of a variety of nature with an overall medium positive effect size of .483 (p = .095). LDP environments appear to be suitable for the practice of waking tasks however practitioners should be aware that perception may at times be distorted from wakefulness. Dream distractions may also be encountered which may impair dream practice and have a negative effect on subsequent performance. A lack of empirical evidence within the literature was identified. Challenges with conducting LDP research are discussed and recommendations for future research are proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"

In the present study several potential indicators of consciousness development, including and especially lucid dreaming frequency, were examined as a function of video game play. In the first study, high video game players were more likely to report lucid dreams, observer dreams, and dream control when dream recall frequency and motion disorientation during play were controlled. There were no similar differences in other consciousness development indices. In the second study, a slightly different pattern of results occurred because of respondents all being frequent players.

10.1037/drm0000043,Inner ghosts: Encounters with threatening dream characters in lucid dreams.,"Lucid dreamers may encounter not only friendly but also threatening dream figures in their lucid dreams. The present study of German-speaking lucid dreamers explored the frequency of threatening dream figures in lucid dreams and how lucid dreamers responded to them. An online questionnaire was completed by 528 respondents, of whom 386 had lucid dream experience. According to their reports, about half of the dream characters encountered in lucid dreams are friendly, but about a fifth of them are threatening. Threatening dream figures are encountered more by women and more frequent nightmare sufferers, but less by more frequent lucid dreamers. When dealing with threatening dream characters, lucid dreamers most often defend themselves by fighting, with flying away and working toward resolution as the next most likely responses. More frequent nightmare sufferers showed more avoidance behavior, whereas more frequent lucid dreamers worked toward resolution of the conflict. The findings lend some support to the idea that encounters with threatening dream characters may represent the interpsychic or psychosocial conflicts of the dreamer. Thus, when encountering a threatening dream figure, lucid dreamers could perhaps be advised not to avoid it, but rather to confront the figure and seek resolution.

10.1037/drm0000094,Measuring attitude toward lucid dreams: A six-item scale.,"In recent years, the interest in lucid dreaming (dreaming with the conscious knowledge that one is dreaming) was stimulated by blockbuster films like âInceptionâ and the media interest in studies indicating that lucid dreaming can be beneficial. However, systematic studies regarding the attitude toward lucid dreams are lacking. An online survey was completed by 1,380 persons (777 women and 603 men), whose mean age was 51.63 Â± 14.13 years. The six-item scale measuring attitude toward lucid dreams showed high internal consistency. The attitude toward lucid dreams was highly correlated with the general attitude toward lucid dreams and decreased with age; women reported a more positive attitude. However, the attitude toward lucid dreams was markedly lower than the attitude toward dreams in general. It would be interesting to study what the bases of the attitude toward lucid dreams are, for example, information in the media, personal experience, and reports of friends.

10.1037/1053-0797.16.1.22,The effects of a two-week reflection-intention training program on lucid dream recall.,"Previous research in the field of lucid dreams has produced several techniques which are claimed to be a means of inducing lucid dreams, but there have been only a small number of reported studies which have evaluated their effectiveness. The present study investigated the effects of one of the most promising of these, the reflection-intention technique, which is specifically designed to increase the frequency of dream and lucid dream recall. The sample here consisted of 20 participants whose frequencies of normal dream recall and lucid dream recall were recorded before, during and after a two week training program by using a dream questionnaire and a dream journal: A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant increase in both dream recall frequency (F2,38 = 22.09, p<.05) and lucid dream recall frequency (F2,38 = 5.96, p<.05). Because there are some reservations concerning the small sample size and a possible subject bias, the findings here concerning the efficiency of the lucid dream induction program are regarded as only suggestive.

10.1037/a0034817,Cognitive structure associated with the lucid features of gamers dreams.,"In a follow-up from Gackenbach and Kuruvilla (2008a), data analysis was undertaken examining the metacognitive qualities of video game players dreams associated with lucidity. Kahan and LaBergeâs (1994) Metacognitive, Affective, Cognitive Experience Questionnaire (MACE) responses were examined in a principle component factor analysis. Several factors loaded dream type and gaming variables along with items from the MACE. It was concluded that gaming may be associated with dream lucidity because of the enhanced problem-solving quality of gamerâs dreams. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000030,Posttraumatic nightmares and imagery rehearsal: The possible role of lucid dreaming.,"Lucid dreaming (LD) is a distinct behavioral state characterized by an awareness of dreaming while a dream occurs and, at times, an ability to, during dreaming, control dream events and/or purposefully awaken from a dream. LD and its potential role as a mechanism of action of Imagery Rehearsal therapy (IR) were investigated in military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder and recurrent nightmares. This study reports on the nature of LD constructs in 33 treatment-seeking Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans participating in a larger clinical trial of 6 sessions of 1 of 2 therapies: components of CognitiveâBehavioral Therapy for Insomnia (cCBT-I) or IR + cCBT-I. Participants completed questionnaires regarding sleep and nightmares, other PTSD symptoms, and LD before and after treatment. Before treatment, veterans demonstrated a LD profile characterized by high dream awareness and low dream content control. After IR + cCBT-I treatment, control of dream content, but not lucid awareness, increased more than after cCBT-I treatment (ES = .68). This increase in dream content control was related to a reduction in nightmare distress. An increase in 1 component of LD, namely control of dream content, appears to contribute to therapeutic change with IR for recurrent posttraumatic nightmares.

10.1037/drm0000035,Physical self-concept and the frequency of lucid dreams and nightmares.,"This study investigated the association of physical self-concept with dream recall frequency, lucid dream frequency, and nightmare frequency. Previous research reported negative associations between physical self-concept and dreaming behavior among sport students. Using a large sample from the general population (N = 2,904), we found no associations of physical self-concept with dream recall frequency and lucid dream frequency. Associations with nightmare frequency were negative and significant, yet practically irrelevant. We conclude that previously reported negative associations of physical self-concept with dream behavior are confined to athletes and persons with above-average physical exercise behavior but do not generalize to the general population.

10.1037/drm0000199,Differences between lucid and nonlucid dream reports: A within-subjects design.,"Lucid dreams are characterized by the awareness of the dreamer that s/he is dreaming. Typically, if the dreamer can control the dream action, pleasurable activities like flying or having sex are chosen. The present study analyzing lucid and nonlucid dream reports reported by 100 persons confirmed previous findings that lucid dreams contain more positive emotions than nonlucid dreams. Moreover, lucid dream reports also included fewer problems, being less often subject to verbal aggression, and fewer death themes. A new finding is that lucid dream reports include fewer verbal interactions and a lower number of dream characters. This would imply that lucid dreamers choose actions that often include having fun by themselves. It would be very interesting to follow up these findings with larger dream content studies and investigate dream content and emotional changes before and after becoming lucid within the same dream.

10.1037/drm0000152,Inducing lucid dreams: The wake-up-back-to-bed technique in the home setting.,"Lucid dreams occur quite rarely, so research has focused on different induction methods to increase lucid dream frequency. In the sleep laboratory setting the wake-up-back-to-bed (WBTB) technique in combination with the mnemonic induction of lucid dreams (MILD) technique is very effective. The present study with N = 50 participants in line with previous studies - indicates that these techniques are also effective at home with a lucid dream percentage of 18% after WBTB nights compared to 6% after non-WBTB nights. Of the 10 naÃ¯ve participants who had never had a lucid dream before, 50% experienced at least one lucid dream during the 5-week period. Future studies using longer time intervals can investigate the questions whether everyone can learn lucid dreaming if s/he puts in the effort and how intensive induction training affect lucid dreaming frequency in the long run.

10.1037/a0036942,Dream characters and the dream ego: An exploratory online study in lucid dreams.,"Two exploratory online experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction between dream characters and the dream ego in lucid dreams. Lucid dreamers were recruited via an Internet page (http://klartraum.de). In Experiment 1, 15 participants (26.5 Â± 10.2 years; 4 female, 11 male) provided 27 dream reports in which they asked dream characters 38 times to guess a number of fingers they show with their hands behind their back and then name another number of fingers that was visible to the dream characters. In Experiment 2, 7 lucid dreamers (24.3 Â± 10.5 years; 2 female, 5 male) guessed 17 different numbers written down by 12 different dream characters. In Experiment 1, the hidden-type question was answered correctly by 19 out of 29 dream characters (66%). In Experiment 2, the correct number was successfully guessed in 10 out of 14 cases (71.4%). The results indicate that there is some form of connection between the dream ego and dream characters. Although the underlying mechanisms are not clear, the findings of this pilot study show that lucid dream studies are an efficient tool to provide knowledge about the characteristics of dream characters.

10.1037/a0039165,"Changes in dream recall frequency, nightmare frequency, and lucid dream frequency over a 3-year period.","Cross-sectional studies indicate that dream recall frequency declines with age; longitudinal studies, however, are scarce. The present data from 2 online dream studies in the same panel carried out independently (N = 1,340 completed both surveys) indicate that there is an overall decline in dream recall frequency, nightmare frequency, and lucid dreaming frequency, even though for the majority of the sample the 3 variables remained quite stable over this time interval. The reasons for this decline are yet poorly understood. Future longitudinal studies should include cognitive measures (visual memory), personality measures (thin boundaries), sleep parameters, stress measures, and attitude toward dreams scales to test whether changes in these measures might explain the changes in the recall measures.

10.1037/drm0000156,I dream therefore I am: A review on lucid dreaming in Western philosophy.,"The first philosopher who referred to lucid dreaming (LD) was Aristotle, who pointed out that something in the dreamersâ consciousness tells them they are dreaming. In the Middle Ages, Aquinas commented that while asleep a man may judge that what he sees is a dream. During enlightenment, Reid alleged that he experienced waking-like cognition during dreams. In the 19th century, Nietzsche mentioned that he sometimes would realize he was dreaming amid a nightmare. In the past century, new arguments were given against the arising of self-consciousness in dreams. Malcolm, for example, based on the incapacity of communicating with the external world during the dream, concluded for the impossibility of a genuine dream âexperienceââwhich would preclude LD. In the 1970s, there was a brief discussion between Dennett, for whom dreams are not experiences, and Emmett, who rebutted his argument citing LD, followed by Dennettâs reply that LDs are merely âillusions of a dream within a dream.â In 1981, the psychophysiologist LaBerge and coworkers recorded LD in the laboratory, which proved scientifically the existence of LD. Nowadays, many philosophers consider dreams as a key phenomenon for the study of consciousness and the mind-body problem, such as Antti Revonsuo, Jennifer Windt, Evan Thompson, and Thomas Metzinger, who agree that LD presents cognitive functions like self-consciousness. In this review, we explore these and other Western thinkers who wrote about LD throughout history. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/cns0000288,Dispelling the shadows of the lucid night: An exploration of potential adverse effects of lucid dreaming.,"Lucid dreamsâdreams in which the dreamer is aware that they are dreamingâare generally positive and empowering experiences, for which a variety of benefits have been demonstrated, for example, alleviating nightmares and insomnia, improving motor skills, contributing to creativity and personal growth. Recently, however, certain concerns were raised about the possible risks of lucid dreaming on sleep and health. This study aimed to explore three potential domains of adverse effectsâsleep quality, dissociation, and mental well-beingâas well as to capture any self-observed negative consequences of lucid dreams within an online sample (N = 489) in which the majority of respondents (94%) were lucid dreamers. According to the results, lucid dream frequency was not associated with poorer sleep quality or with greater dissociation but was linked to greater mental well-being. Moreover, most of the lucid dreams were reported to be emotionally positive experiences and the majority of lucid dreamers did not ascribe any negative consequences to lucid dreaming. Thus, at least from the present findings, the experience of lucid dreaming does not seem to exert evident detrimental effects, although a small proportion of lucid dreams (about 10%) were negatively toned. However, to establish causal relationships future longitudinal studies are needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/drm0000163,Lucid dreams in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder include nightmares.,"A previous study in military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and recurrent nightmares found a high prevalence of lucid dreaming (LD), the awareness while a dream continues that one is dreaming, and an âLD profileâ characterized by frequent dream awareness and rare dream content control. Given the importance of the nightmare disturbance in PTSD, this study assessed with questionnaires the prevalence and characteristics of lucid nightmares, specifically, in a sample of 54 veterans with PTSD. Over half the sample endorsed experiencing LD, with nearly all of these individuals explicitly reporting lucidity in nightmares. The lucid nightmare profile was characterized by high awareness and low content control. Veterans reported feeling stuck and anxious, trying unsuccessfully to awaken from lucid nightmares. We conclude that lucid nightmares may occur commonly in veterans with PTSD, with a profile resembling that previously reported for LD experiences generally in this group.

10.1037/drm0000044,"Exploring the role of need for cognition, field independence and locus of control on the incidence of lucid dreams during a 12-week induction study.","This article reports an investigation of 2 proposed theories, the predispositional and experiential, regarding the association of personality variables to lucid dreaming incidence during a 12-week lucid dreaming induction program. The study found no differences between those who did and did not report lucid dreams during the program on baseline measures of field independence, locus of control or need for cognition. There was an observed significant change toward a field independent orientation between baseline and posttests for those successful at inducing a lucid dream; with no statistically significant differences for either Locus of Control or Need for Cognition. Results suggest that field independence may not be a predispositional characteristic for the successful induction of lucid dreaming, but an experiential result of having lucid dream experiences. The authors conclude that experiences within a dream state may have appreciable effects on waking cognition. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
10.1037/cns0000331,Overcoming phobias by lucid dreaming.,"Lucid dreams (LDs) are dreams in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming. LDs have a much broader range of possibilities for modeling situations than the physical world. Owing to this feature of LDs, and according to previous studies, they can be used for psychotherapeutic purposes, including reducing anxiety and fear. In the present study, we investigate the association between fear reduction and fear level, both during wakefulness and in LDs. We instructed 76 LD practitioners to encounter the object of their fear in an LD. Upon awakening, they evaluated how much fear they felt in the LD and after awakening. After experiencing their fear in LD, 51% and 49% of volunteers reported lower and the same fear upon awakening, respectively. Stronger fear before LD was associated with a greater effect of its reduction after LD (2.5 times more often). Our study confirms lucid dreamingâs efficiency in helping people overcome their fears, especially phobias. In this way, our results highlight the psychotherapeutic benefits of LD.

10.1037/h0094353,Russia. Dreaming. Liberation.,"This essay is the narrative of an AIDS patient who attended the âDreaming in Russiaâ conference in August of 1991. Arriving in Moscow on the day of the coup, the international group was gripped by fear. Though he had been engulfed by a certain darkness over the summer, the author discovered that his own personal cataclysm melted into the greater socio-historical cataclysm providing a great release as well as a genuine concern for issues more global. Fresh dreams are recorded throughout making clearer the events of the days. The account of the funeral procession for the three Russians killed by the tanks and the visit to the monastery of Zagorsk (seat of the Russian Orthodox patriarchy) eventually lead to a description of a very successful group dreamwork on the theme of âfacing death.â Dreams and dreamwork are regarded as ways of coping with our own existential dramas.
