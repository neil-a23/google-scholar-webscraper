The original goal of this study was to investigate musical practice in lucid dreams and its possible effects as well as the quality of the experiences. A total of 5 musicians were interviewed about their lucid dreams in which they had played instruments and sung. However, the interviewees were more interested in pleasure and inspiration than in actual practice and skill improvement. Therefore, the results provide more general information than planned. It could be shown that singing and playing musical instruments mostly work well in lucid dreams. Lucid music dreams were often accompanied by positive emotions and led to several positive effects in waking life, like facilitated guitar playing and enhanced confidence. Two interviewees especially enjoyed improvising solo in lucid dreams. The participants also emphasized the creative and inspirational potential of lucid music dreams, which is worth further investigation. Combining previous research on athletic practice in lucid dreams and the clues obtained from this study, it is likely that musicians could use lucid dreams to improve their skills. Future studies should further explore the potential of lucid music dreams for both creativity and performance in waking life. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

Results show that frequent lucid dreamers solve significantly more insight problems overall than nonlucid dreamers.

It was hypothesized that lucid dreamers would perform better on change blindness tasks than would nonlucid dreamers. Contrary to the hypothesis, individuals who reported having lucid dreams more than once per month (n = 13), occasional lucid dreamers (n = 13), and nonlucid dreamers (n = 12) were found not to differ significantly on performance on 6 change blindness tasks.

Seven men and four women experienced in lucid dreaming underwent polysomnographic recordings in the sleep laboratory on two consecutive nights. EEG signals were subjected to spectral analysis to obtain five different frequency bands between 1 and 20 Hz. Lucidity was determined by both subjective dream reports and eye-movement signals made by the subjects in response to light stimuli indicating a REM period. The main discrimination factor between lucid and nonlucid dreaming was found in the beta-1 frequency band (13-19 Hz), which in lucid dreaming was increased in both parietal regions. The ratio of frontal to parietal beta-1 activity was 1 to 1.16 in nonlucid and 1 to 1.77 in lucid dreaming.

The current study extends this work by investigating the association between lucid dream frequency and alarm clock use. Eighty-four participants (44 females, 39 males, 1 not stated, mean age = 33.80 years, SD = 15.00) completed an online retrospective questionnaire that measured lucid dreaming frequency, frequency of alarm clock use, frequency of snooze button use per morning, and average number of awakenings per night. Significant positive relationships were found between lucid dreaming frequency and number of awakenings per night (ρ = .30), number of uses of alarm clock snoozing function per morning (ρ = .22), and dream recall frequency (ρ = .52). In a logistic regression, whether a participant had ever had a lucid dream was predicted only by overall dream recall frequency and frequency of snooze button use (Exp(B) odds ratios = 4.92 and 2.52, respectively). Reasons for the association might be that lucid dreamers and snooze button users share some individual difference characteristic or that the brief awakenings followed by snoozing might elicit brain activation or sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, hence resulting in a greater likelihood of lucid dreams.

The present survey was completed by 3,992 Americans 18 years and older in age (2,310 women and 1,682 men), with a mean age of 48.26 ± 17.09 years. Lucid dream occurrence in the total sample was 35.72%, with Hispanic participants reporting a significantly lower frequency of lucid dreams compared with White participants, a difference that might reflect a greater prominence of lucid dreaming in more individualistic cultures versus more communitarian cultures. Although the findings of this study suggest specific cultural effects on lucid dream frequency and other aspects of dreaming, more empirical research is needed to help to clarify how strongly these effects may appear in dreaming in general, and lucid dreaming in particular, among a wider range of today’s world population.

https://doi.org/10.1037/1053-0797.18.2.112,Cardiovascular responses to dreamed physical exercise during REM lucid dreaming.,"Previous studies have demonstrated intriguing psychophysiological correspondences when lucid dreamers carried out specific tasks during lucid dreams (e.g., eye movements and EMG activities). But only a few studies have investigated cardiovascular changes during dreamed physical activities. This study tests the hypothesis that physical activity (performing squats) carried out in a lucid dream increases cardiovascular parameters in the sleeping body. Therefore, 5 proficient lucid dreamers experienced with the eye-signaling method during lucidity spent 2 to 4 nonconsecutive nights in a sleep laboratory. Instructed to carry out specific tasks (counting and performing squats) while lucid dreaming, the participants reported becoming lucid and signaling in 11 REM periods recorded. Fourteen complete lucid dream tasks were verified by eye signaling. The results showed a statistically significant increase of heart rate between the preexercise and exercise periods and the postexercise period. The results for respiration rate were less clear. Even though respiration rate during the exercise period was higher than during the pre- and postexercise period, statistical significance was only found for the second comparison. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that lucidly dreamed motor action causes increases at the level of peripheral effectors. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0020881,Association of lucid dreaming frequency with Stroop task performance.,"Lucid dreaming involves the attentional skill of having metacognition about the dreamer's state of consciousness at the same time as being engaged in the dream scenario. A combination of two levels of cognition also occurs in the incongruent condition of the Stroop task, where there is interference between the attentional demands of a relatively difficult (color naming) and an easy (reading) task. It was thus hypothesized that frequent lucid dreamers would perform better on the Stroop task than would nonlucid dreamers. Individuals who reported having lucid dreams more than once per month (n = 15) were found to be significantly faster on the incongruent condition of the Stroop task than were occasional lucid dreamers (n = 15) or nonlucid dreamers (n = 15). The groups did not differ on the standard colored nonword control condition. Continuity in attentional ability between waking and dreaming cognition was thus found. This continuity may counteract the psychophysiologically dominant and possibly evolutionarily selected lack of self-awareness in dreams.
