https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094362,"Examined the lucid dreams of 50 Ss as to whether they are also fully lucid for the following corollaries: people in the dreams are dream characters, dream objects are not real, (i.e., actions will not carry over concretely upon awakening), the dreamer does not need to obey waking-life physics to achieve a goal, and memory of the waking world is intact rather than amnestic or fictitious. Many lucid dreams were too brief to evaluate on all corollaries. Only about half of the lengthier accounts were lucid for any particular corollary and less than a quarter were lucid on all 4. A related and reciprocal category of dreams that are lucid in terms of some of these 4 corollaries but miss the realization that ""I'm dreaming"" were also examined. The correlations among the corollaries, between correlations and length of lucid dreams, and between awareness and degree of experience with lucidity imply that they are on a cohesive continuum.

Reality checkers reported that lucid dreams were a habitual termination of their FAs significantly more often than nonreality checkers (p < .001). This appears to be the first empirical datum in support of the frequently self-reported ability of lucid dreamers to turn “actively” their FAs into lucid dreams.

An online survey was completed by 634 participants, of whom 574 had had previous lucid dream experience. According to the reports of lucid dreamers, less than half of them had experienced a lucid nightmare, and only 1% of them could be considered as suffering from lucid nightmares—experiencing them once a week or more frequently. Lucid nightmares appear to be as distressing as ordinary nightmares. Lack of dream control and intense fear are among their most common features, followed by violent autonomous dream characters and the inability to wake up. Lucid nightmares are more likely to occur for women and nightmare sufferers, yet also for more frequent lucid dreamers and for those who experience lucid dreams spontaneously rather than them being induced deliberately. Key methodological points, for example, whether the awakening criterion in the definition of lucid nightmares should be included, are addressed, and suggestions for future research are provided.

https://doi.org/10.1037/drm0000188,Lucid nightmare as a state midway between nightmare and lucid dream.,"Lucid nightmares, which are distinguished by their qualities pertaining to both nightmares and lucid dreams, might constitute a hybrid state in between a nightmare and a lucid dream. To test the notion that some lucid dreams might be transformed from nightmares, this study examined a structural equation model in which nightmares were hypothesized to predict lucid nightmares and therefore lucid dreams, with consideration of positive and negative trait emotions. This model was tested on a sample of 249 Hong Kong Chinese adults. The latent constructs of the model were indicated by the items and subscales adopted from the Dream Intensity Scale, Dream Motif Scale, Brief Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale, and Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory. The structural equation modeling analysis supported the proposed role of lucid nightmare and negative emotionality as a predictor of nightmares.

The present study confirmed that lucid dreamers, both frequent and occasional (n = 26), were more internal on J. Rotter's (1966) locus of control measure and scored higher on J. Cacioppo and R. Petty's (1982) need for cognition measure than did nonlucid dreamers (n = 24). Frequent but not occasional lucid dreamers were more field independent on H. A. Witkin et al.'s (1971) Group Embedded Figures Test than the nonlucid dreamers. Need for cognition, internality on locus of control, and field independence all correlated with each other. The results can be argued to show a continuity between styles of waking and dreaming personality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
https://doi.org/10.1037/drm0000073,Lucid music – A pilot study exploring the experiences and potential of music-making in lucid dreams.,"In a lucid dream, the dreamer knows that he or she is dreaming and can thus deliberately carry out actions. The original goal of this study was to investigate musical practice in lucid dreams and its possible effects as well as the quality of the experiences. A total of 5 musicians were interviewed about their lucid dreams in which they had played instruments and sung. However, the interviewees were more interested in pleasure and inspiration than in actual practice and skill improvement. Therefore, the results provide more general information than planned. It could be shown that singing and playing musical instruments mostly work well in lucid dreams. Lucid music dreams were often accompanied by positive emotions and led to several positive effects in waking life, like facilitated guitar playing and enhanced confidence. Two interviewees especially enjoyed improvising solo in lucid dreams. The participants also emphasized the creative and inspirational potential of lucid music dreams, which is worth further investigation. Combining previous research on athletic practice in lucid dreams and the clues obtained from this study, it is likely that musicians could use lucid dreams to improve their skills. Future studies should further explore the potential of lucid music dreams for both creativity and performance in waking life. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036908,Spontaneous lucid dreaming frequency and waking insight.,"Spontaneous lucid dreaming is characterized by the realization that the currently perceived reality is in fact a dream. As this ability differs between individuals, specific cognitive abilities have been sought that might explain this variability. Here, “insight,” a key feature of spontaneous lucid dreaming, is investigated. Frequent, occasional, and nonlucid dreamers were compared on their successful performance of a compound remote associate problem-solving task, designed to measure insight. Results show that frequent lucid dreamers solve significantly more insight problems overall than nonlucid dreamers. This suggests that the insight experienced during the dream state may relate to the same underlying cognition needed for insight in the waking state.

https://doi.org/10.1037/a0017994,Cerebral specialization during lucid dreaming: A right hemisphere hypothesis.,"Research has shown that certain individuals are able to carry out prearranged tasks while lucid dreaming, and that these tasks produce physiological effects on the body similar to what is observed during waking. It was hypothesized that the difficulty of performing cerebrally lateralized tasks during a lucid dream would vary with the dominant hemisphere for that task, with less difficulty for right hemisphere tasks. Twenty-seven participants rated the difficulty of performing three matched pairs of left hemisphere and right hemisphere tasks, first in a lucid dream, and later in their waking imagination. Results indicated right hemisphere dominance during lucid dreaming, especially among right-handed participants. (APA PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
https://doi.org/10.1037/a0019248,Lucid dreaming frequency and change blindness performance.,"There are reports of lucid dreaming being cued by the recognition that a dream event is bizarre from the point of view of waking life. However, for dreams in general, there is a lack of ability to notice or question bizarre occurrences. A waking-life analog of this inability is here proposed to be change blindness. In change blindness tasks, a prominent alteration to a photograph occurs repeatedly, but it is rare for these changes to be spotted immediately. It was hypothesized that lucid dreamers would perform better on change blindness tasks than would nonlucid dreamers. Contrary to the hypothesis, individuals who reported having lucid dreams more than once per month (n = 13), occasional lucid dreamers (n = 13), and nonlucid dreamers (n = 12) were found not to differ significantly on performance on 6 change blindness tasks. How the usually proficient unconscious detection of errors during waking life is disabled during dreams remains to be determined, but it does not seem from the results here to have a simple relationship with the waking-life phenomenon of change blindness.

https://doi.org/10.1037/1053-0797.16.2.88,Psychophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming.,"The main goal of the present study was to explore electrophysiological differences between lucid and nonlucid dreams in REM sleep. Seven men and four women experienced in lucid dreaming underwent polysomnographic recordings in the sleep laboratory on two consecutive nights. EEG signals were subjected to spectral analysis to obtain five different frequency bands between 1 and 20 Hz. Lucidity was determined by both subjective dream reports and eye-movement signals made by the subjects in response to light stimuli indicating a REM period. The main discrimination factor between lucid and nonlucid dreaming was found in the beta-1 frequency band (13-19 Hz), which in lucid dreaming was increased in both parietal regions. The ratio of frontal to parietal beta-1 activity was 1 to 1.16 in nonlucid and 1 to 1.77 in lucid dreaming. A tendency towards the greatest increase was observed in the left parietal lobe (P3), an area of the brain considered to be related to semantic understanding and self-awareness.

https://doi.org/10.1037/h0094432,Validity established of DreamLight cues for eliciting lucid dreaming.,"Examined the effectiveness of DreamLight (DL), a biofeedback device designed to deliver light cues during REM sleep, for inducing lucid dreams. 14 adults used DLs in their home on 4 to 24 nights. They were unaware that the DLs were specially programmed to deliver cues only on alternate nights. 11 Ss reported 32 lucid dreams, 22 from nights with light cues and 10 from nights without cues. All lucid dreams scored (by judges blind to DL condition) as being cued by the DL's stimuli, occurred on nights when the DL was actually delivering cues. Ss reported seeing in their dreams what they believed to be DL cues significantly more often on light cue nights (73 total) compared to nights without light cues (9). It is concluded that cuing with sensory stimuli by the DL appears to increase a S's probability of having lucid dreams, and that most of the resulting lucid dreams are due to the specific effect of light cues rather than general placebo factors.
